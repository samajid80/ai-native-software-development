**2. Forbidden Ending Section** ✅
- **File**: `06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/08-extensions-security-and-ide-integration.md`
- **Issue**: "What's Next" navigation section (minimal content violation)
- **Fix**: Removed forbidden section; lesson ends with substantive content
- **Impact**: +7 points to Constitutional Compliance

### P1 Major Improvements (Completed)

**3. Intelligence Accumulation** ✅
- **Files**: `07-bash-essentials/README.md`, `08-git-and-github/README.md`

- Chapter 8 → Chapter 5 & 7 backward references (Claude Code + Bash skills compose)
- Explicit skill composition: Bash navigation + Git version control + AI assistance

**4. Link Validation** ✅
- **Scope**: Chapter cross-references validated
- **Results**: Internal chapter references (5-8) verified accurate and consistent
- **Impact**: +1 point to Metadata & Technical

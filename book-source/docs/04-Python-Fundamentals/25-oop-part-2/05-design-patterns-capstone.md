# Design Patterns (Capstone)

## Introduction: Architectural Thinking at Scale

You've spent Lessons 1-4 mastering the fundamental tools of object-oriented design: inheritance hierarchies, polymorphism, composition, and special methods. Now comes the moment where these tools become architecture.

**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common architectural problems. They're the vocabulary of professional software engineering—when you tell another developer "we'll use the Observer pattern for agent communication," they immediately understand your architecture without you explaining details.

In this capstone lesson, you'll implement four industry-standard patterns in a real AI agent system. Each pattern solves a specific problem:

- **Singleton**: Ensure only one manager coordinates all agents
- **Factory**: Create different agent types dynamically without hardcoding classes
- **Observer**: Enable event-driven agent communication
- **Strategy**: Let agents select different decision-making approaches at runtime

By the end, you'll have built a professional multi-agent architecture that integrates all 4 patterns—the kind of system you'd encounter in production AI applications.

**Why this matters**: Design patterns separate junior developers from architects. Junior developers write code that works. Architects design systems that scale, adapt, and integrate. This lesson transitions you from code-writing to architectural thinking.

## Part 1: Singleton Pattern — Global State Done Right

### The Problem: Too Many Instances

Imagine you're building an agent management system. Every part of your code needs access to *the same* agent manager—no duplicates, no inconsistency. How do you ensure only one instance exists?

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Each call creates new instance
manager1 = AgentManager()
manager2 = AgentManager()
manager1.register_agent(agent1)
manager2.register_agent(agent2)
# Now agents are split between two managers—inconsistent state!
```

The **Singleton pattern** solves this: guarantee exactly one instance, globally accessible.

### The Solution: Singleton Implementation

```python
class AgentManager:
    """Singleton pattern - ensures only one instance exists globally"""

    _instance: 'AgentManager' | None = None
    _initialized: bool = False

    def __new__(cls) -> 'AgentManager':
        """Control instance creation at the class level"""
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize only once, even if __new__ is called multiple times"""
        if self._initialized:
            return
        self._initialized = True
        self.agents: list[dict] = []
        self.agent_map: dict[str, dict] = {}

    def register_agent(self, agent_id: str, agent_data: dict) -> None:
        """Register an agent with the manager"""
        self.agents.append(agent_data)
        self.agent_map[agent_id] = agent_data
        print(f"✅ Registered agent: {agent_id}")

    def get_agent(self, agent_id: str) -> dict | None:
        """Retrieve an agent by ID"""
        return self.agent_map.get(agent_id)

    def list_agents(self) -> list[str]:
        """Get all registered agent IDs"""
        return list(self.agent_map.keys())


# Test singleton behavior
manager1 = AgentManager()
manager2 = AgentManager()

print(f"Same instance? {manager1 is manager2}")  # True!
print(f"manager1 id: {id(manager1)}")
print(f"manager2 id: {id(manager2)}")

manager1.register_agent("chat_bot", {"name": "ChatBot", "type": "chat"})
manager2.register_agent("code_bot", {"name": "CodeBot", "type": "code"})

# Both see the same agents because they're the same instance
print(f"Agents in manager1: {manager1.list_agents()}")  # ['chat_bot', 'code_bot']
print(f"Agents in manager2: {manager2.list_agents()}")  # ['chat_bot', 'code_bot']
```

**How it works**:

1. `__new__()` controls instance creation. First call creates instance and saves it in `_instance`. Subsequent calls return the same instance.
2. `__init__()` might be called multiple times (once per reference), so we guard initialization with `_initialized` flag.
3. Result: `AgentManager()` always returns the exact same object, no matter how many times you call it.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> Singletons are controversial in software engineering. **Use for**: configuration managers, loggers, connection pools—stateless or simple-state resources. **Avoid for**: anything that needs different state in tests or multiple independent instances. The controversy exists because global state makes testing and reasoning about code harder. But for true global coordination points (like the agent manager), Singleton is appropriate.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain the difference between Singleton pattern and a module-level variable. Why use Singleton instead of just `manager = AgentManager()` at module level? What problem does Singleton solve that module-level variables don't?"

## Part 2: Factory Pattern — Decoupling Object Creation

### The Problem: Tight Coupling to Concrete Classes

As your system grows, you have multiple agent types:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded creation, tightly coupled
if agent_type == "chat":
    agent = ChatAgent(name)
elif agent_type == "code":
    agent = CodeAgent(name)
elif agent_type == "data":
    agent = DataAgent(name)
else:
    raise ValueError("Unknown agent type")
```

This is fragile. Adding a new agent type requires changing this code everywhere. The **Factory pattern** decouples object creation from usage.

### The Solution: Factory Implementation

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Agent(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all agents"""

    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, message: str) -> str:
        """All agents must implement message processing"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_capabilities(self) -> list[str]:
        """All agents must declare their capabilities"""
        pass


class ChatAgent(Agent):
    """Agent specialized for conversational interaction"""

    def process(self, message: str) -> str:
        return f"ChatAgent {self.name}: Processing conversation '{message}'"

    def get_capabilities(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["conversation", "context_understanding", "multi-turn_dialogue"]


class CodeAgent(Agent):
    """Agent specialized for code analysis and generation"""

    def process(self, message: str) -> str:
        return f"CodeAgent {self.name}: Analyzing code '{message}'"

    def get_capabilities(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["code_analysis", "syntax_checking", "refactoring", "testing"]


class DataAgent(Agent):
    """Agent specialized for data processing"""

    def process(self, message: str) -> str:
        return f"DataAgent {self.name}: Processing data '{message}'"

    def get_capabilities(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["data_analysis", "visualization", "cleaning", "aggregation"]


class AgentFactory:
    """Factory pattern - creates agents without specifying concrete classes"""

    # Registry maps agent type strings to classes
    _registry: dict[str, type[Agent]] = {
        "chat": ChatAgent,
        "code": CodeAgent,
        "data": DataAgent,
    }

    @classmethod
    def create_agent(cls, agent_type: str, name: str) -> Agent:
        """Create an agent by type name"""
        agent_class = cls._registry.get(agent_type)
        if agent_class is None:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Unknown agent type: {agent_type}. "
                f"Available: {list(cls._registry.keys())}"
            )
        return agent_class(name)

    @classmethod
    def register_agent_type(cls, type_name: str, agent_class: type[Agent]) -> None:
        """Register a new agent type (enables extension without modifying factory)"""
        cls._registry[type_name] = agent_class

    @classmethod
    def available_types(cls) -> list[str]:
        """List all registered agent types"""
        return list(cls._registry.keys())


# Usage: Create agents without knowing concrete classes
agents: list[Agent] = [
    AgentFactory.create_agent("chat", "ChatBot1"),
    AgentFactory.create_agent("code", "CodeHelper"),
    AgentFactory.create_agent("data", "DataAnalyzer"),
]

# Process messages polymorphically
for agent in agents:
    print(agent.process("Hello"))
    print(f"Capabilities: {agent.get_capabilities()}")
    print()
```

**How it works**:

1. `Agent` is an abstract interface. Concrete agents (ChatAgent, CodeAgent, DataAgent) implement it.
2. `AgentFactory.create_agent()` takes a type string and returns the appropriate agent.
3. The registry pattern allows new agent types to be added without modifying the factory method.
4. Code that uses agents doesn't care what concrete type it is—it just calls the `Agent` interface.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "Show me how to extend this factory with a registry pattern where agents can self-register their types. Then demonstrate creating a custom `RAGAgent` that automatically registers itself without modifying `AgentFactory` code."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand how to decouple class registration from class creation, enabling true plugin-like architecture.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> The Factory pattern is critical in AI systems. Your agent creation might be dynamic—loading from configuration, database, or user choice. Factory decouples "which agent type" (decided at runtime) from "how to create it" (stateless factory code). This is professional architecture.

## Part 3: Observer Pattern — Event-Driven Architecture

### The Problem: Tight Coupling Between Components

Imagine agents need to react to events:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Direct coupling, hard to extend
agent1.receive_message("event")
agent2.receive_message("event")
agent3.receive_message("event")
# What if you add agent4? Modify all code?
# What if agents need different reactions? Hard to manage
```

The **Observer pattern** decouples senders from receivers using an event bus.

### The Solution: Observer Implementation

```python
from typing import Protocol

class Observer(Protocol):
    """Observer interface - any object with update() method can observe"""

    def update(self, event_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
        """Called when subject publishes an event"""
        ...


class EventBus:
    """Subject - manages observers and publishes events"""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._observers: list[Observer] = []
        self._event_history: list[dict] = []

    def attach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        """Register an observer"""
        if observer not in self._observers:
            self._observers.append(observer)
            print(f"✅ Observer attached")

    def detach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        """Unregister an observer"""
        if observer in self._observers:
            self._observers.remove(observer)
            print(f"✅ Observer detached")

    def notify(self, event_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
        """Notify all observers of an event"""
        event = {"type": event_type, "data": data}
        self._event_history.append(event)

        print(f"📢 Publishing event: {event_type}")
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(event_type, data)

    def get_history(self) -> list[dict]:
        """Retrieve event history"""
        return self._event_history


class Agent:
    """Agent that observes events"""

    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name

    def update(self, event_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
        """React to published events"""
        print(f"  → {self.name} received {event_type}: {data}")


class TaskQueue:
    """Another observer type - queue incoming tasks"""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.tasks: list[dict] = []

    def update(self, event_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
        """Add tasks from events to queue"""
        if event_type == "task_created":
            self.tasks.append(data)
            print(f"  → TaskQueue queued: {data.get('task_id')}")


class Logger:
    """Another observer - logs all events"""

    def __init__(self, filename: str) -> None:
        self.filename = filename
        self.logs: list[str] = []

    def update(self, event_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
        """Log event to file (simulated)"""
        log_entry = f"[{event_type}] {data}"
        self.logs.append(log_entry)
        print(f"  → Logger recorded: {event_type}")


# Build an event-driven system
event_bus = EventBus()

agent1 = Agent("Agent1")
agent2 = Agent("Agent2")
task_queue = TaskQueue()
logger = Logger("system.log")

# All observers attach to the same event bus
event_bus.attach(agent1)
event_bus.attach(agent2)
event_bus.attach(task_queue)
event_bus.attach(logger)

# Publish events - all observers react automatically
event_bus.notify("user_message", {"user_id": "user123", "message": "Hello"})
event_bus.notify("task_created", {"task_id": "task001", "priority": "high"})
event_bus.notify("agent_status_changed", {"agent_id": "agent1", "status": "busy"})

print(f"\nEvent history: {event_bus.get_history()}")
print(f"Queued tasks: {task_queue.tasks}")
print(f"Log entries: {logger.logs}")
```

**How it works**:

1. `Observer` is a protocol (interface) - any object with `update()` can observe.
2. `EventBus` maintains a list of observers and publishes events to all.
3. Observers (`Agent`, `TaskQueue`, `Logger`) react independently when events are published.
4. Adding new observer types requires no changes to EventBus.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain how the Observer pattern differs from polling. In polling, an agent repeatedly checks 'Has an event happened?' In Observer, the event bus notifies agents. Why is event-driven better for AI agent systems that need to react in real-time?"

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "Extend this system with event filtering: observers should only receive events they care about. Implement a subscription system where agents subscribe to specific event types, and EventBus only notifies relevant observers."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand selective notification, reducing unnecessary processing.

## Part 4: Strategy Pattern — Runtime Algorithm Selection

### The Problem: Hardcoded Decision Logic

Agents need different decision-making strategies depending on context:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Logic embedded in agent, hard to change
class Agent:
    def make_decision(self, context):
        if context['threat_level'] > 7:
            return "retreat"
        else:
            return "advance"
        # What if we need different logic? Modify Agent?
```

The **Strategy pattern** encapsulates algorithms so they're interchangeable.

### The Solution: Strategy Implementation

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DecisionStrategy(ABC):
    """Strategy interface - all strategies must implement decide()"""

    @abstractmethod
    def decide(self, context: dict) -> str:
        """Make a decision based on context"""
        pass


class AggressiveStrategy(DecisionStrategy):
    """Always attack"""

    def decide(self, context: dict) -> str:
        return "🔥 Aggressive: Attack immediately"


class DefensiveStrategy(DecisionStrategy):
    """Prioritize safety"""

    def decide(self, context: dict) -> str:
        return "🛡️ Defensive: Retreat and regroup"


class BalancedStrategy(DecisionStrategy):
    """Adapt based on threat level"""

    def decide(self, context: dict) -> str:
        threat = context.get('threat_level', 5)

        if threat > 8:
            return "⚠️ Balanced: Tactical retreat"
        elif threat > 5:
            return "⚠️ Balanced: Cautious advance"
        else:
            return "⚠️ Balanced: Confident push forward"


class AdaptiveStrategy(DecisionStrategy):
    """Learn from history"""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.success_count: int = 0
        self.failure_count: int = 0

    def decide(self, context: dict) -> str:
        # Simplified: attack if we've been successful
        if self.success_count > self.failure_count:
            return "📈 Adaptive: Attack (success history favors it)"
        else:
            return "📈 Adaptive: Defend (learn from failures)"

    def record_success(self) -> None:
        """Update success history"""
        self.success_count += 1

    def record_failure(self) -> None:
        """Update failure history"""
        self.failure_count += 1


class Agent:
    """Agent uses Strategy pattern for decision-making"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, strategy: DecisionStrategy) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.strategy = strategy

    def set_strategy(self, strategy: DecisionStrategy) -> None:
        """Switch strategies at runtime"""
        self.strategy = strategy
        print(f"  → {self.name} switched strategy")

    def make_decision(self, context: dict) -> str:
        """Delegate decision to strategy"""
        return f"{self.name}: {self.strategy.decide(context)}"


# Create agents with different strategies
context = {'threat_level': 6, 'resources': 100}

agent = Agent("Agent1", BalancedStrategy())

print("Initial strategy (Balanced):")
print(agent.make_decision(context))

# Switch to aggressive strategy
agent.set_strategy(AggressiveStrategy())
print("\nAfter switching to Aggressive:")
print(agent.make_decision(context))

# Switch to defensive strategy
agent.set_strategy(DefensiveStrategy())
print("\nAfter switching to Defensive:")
print(agent.make_decision(context))

# Use adaptive strategy that learns
adaptive = AdaptiveStrategy()
agent.set_strategy(adaptive)
print("\nAdaptive strategy (initially neutral):")
print(agent.make_decision(context))

adaptive.record_success()
adaptive.record_success()
print("\nAfter 2 successes:")
print(agent.make_decision(context))
```

**How it works**:

1. `DecisionStrategy` defines the interface for all strategies.
2. Concrete strategies (Aggressive, Defensive, Balanced, Adaptive) implement different algorithms.
3. `Agent` holds a reference to a strategy and delegates decisions to it.
4. `set_strategy()` switches strategies at runtime without changing Agent code.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> Strategy pattern is essential in AI systems. Different models, different reasoning approaches, different risk profiles—all are strategies. By encapsulating them, agents adapt their behavior without core logic changes. This is how real AI systems handle A/B testing and experimentation.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "Design a CompoundStrategy that combines multiple strategies (like an ensemble). Have an agent use multiple strategies and aggregate their decisions. Show how this pattern enables collaborative decision-making."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand strategy composition, a technique used in real ensemble AI systems.

## Part 5: Bringing It All Together — The Multi-Agent Architecture

Now you'll integrate all 4 patterns into a cohesive system:

```python
# ============================================================
# CAPSTONE: Integrated Multi-Agent System
# Singleton + Factory + Observer + Strategy
# ============================================================

# 1. SINGLETON: Global agent manager
manager = AgentManager()

# 2. FACTORY: Create agents dynamically
print("Creating agents with Factory pattern:")
agents = [
    AgentFactory.create_agent("chat", "ChatBot"),
    AgentFactory.create_agent("code", "CodeHelper"),
    AgentFactory.create_agent("data", "DataAnalyzer"),
]

for agent_obj in agents:
    manager.register_agent(agent_obj.name, {"instance": agent_obj})

# 3. OBSERVER: Event-driven communication
print("\nSetting up event-driven communication:")
event_bus = EventBus()

# Wrap agents as observers
class AgentObserver:
    """Adapts Agent to Observer protocol"""
    def __init__(self, agent: Agent) -> None:
        self.agent = agent

    def update(self, event_type: str, data: dict) -> None:
        """Agent reacts to events"""
        message = data.get('message', '')
        response = self.agent.process(message)
        print(f"    {response}")

# Attach all agents to event bus
for agent_obj in agents:
    observer = AgentObserver(agent_obj)
    event_bus.attach(observer)

# 4. STRATEGY: Agents with decision strategies
print("\nAdding Strategy pattern for agent decisions:")
strategies = {
    agents[0]: AggressiveStrategy(),  # ChatBot is aggressive
    agents[1]: BalancedStrategy(),    # CodeHelper is balanced
    agents[2]: DefensiveStrategy(),   # DataAnalyzer is defensive
}

# Simulate agent decision-making
context = {'threat_level': 6, 'complexity': 'high'}
for agent_obj, strategy in strategies.items():
    decision = strategy.decide(context)
    print(f"  {agent_obj.name} decides: {decision}")

# 5. ORCHESTRATION: Events trigger agent actions
print("\nPublishing events (triggers all agents via Observer):")
event_bus.notify("user_request", {
    "message": "Please help me understand this error",
    "user_id": "user123"
})

# Check manager state (Singleton)
print(f"\nAgents registered with Singleton manager: {manager.list_agents()}")
```

**What you've accomplished**:

1. **Singleton** (`AgentManager`): Single coordination point for all agents
2. **Factory** (`AgentFactory`): Dynamic agent creation by type
3. **Observer** (`EventBus`): Event-driven agent communication
4. **Strategy**: Each agent uses a decision strategy

These patterns work together seamlessly because each solves one specific problem:
- Singleton handles *global state*
- Factory handles *object creation*
- Observer handles *loose coupling communication*
- Strategy handles *algorithm selection*

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> This integrated system represents professional architecture. In production AI systems:
> - Singleton coordinates resources (expensive to create, need single instance)
> - Factory enables dynamic agent creation from config or user input
> - Observer enables asynchronous, loosely-coupled agent communication

## Challenge: Building Complex AI Systems with Design Patterns

In this capstone challenge, you'll integrate all four design patterns (plus additional ones) into a complete agent orchestration system. This is where theory meets practice—designing production-ready architectures.

---

## Part 1: Student Discovers Pattern Interactions Through a Growing System

**Your Role**: System architect designing for evolving requirements

### Discovery Exercise: Build Agent Systems, Discover Missing Patterns

Imagine you're building a customer service platform with increasingly complex requirements.

**Stage 1: Naive Implementation (Single-Agent)**

Start simple—one agent, no patterns:

```python
# Stage 1: No patterns - simple chatbot
class ChatAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

    def process(self, message: str) -> str:
        return f"Chat response: {message}"

# Usage
agent = ChatAgent("Helper")
print(agent.process("help me"))
```

**Your task 1**: Document in `pattern_evolution_analysis.md`:
- How many ChatAgent instances exist? (Can there be multiple?)
- How do you create different agent types without modifying ChatAgent?
- How would agents communicate with each other?
- What happens when you need to switch algorithms at runtime?

**Stage 2: Requirements Grow**

Now you need:
- Multiple agent types (ChatAgent, TicketAgent, EscalationAgent)
- Agents to communicate via events
- Different routing strategies based on sentiment
- Only one manager coordinating all agents

Document:
- How would you create different agent types without duplicate code?
- How would agents notify each other of events?
- How would you select routing strategy dynamically?
- Which design patterns solve each problem?

### Your Discovery Document

Create `pattern_necessity_analysis.md` with:

1. **Single Instance Problem**: Multiple managers cause conflicts; need Singleton
2. **Creation Complexity Problem**: Creating different agent types is repetitive; need Factory
3. **Communication Problem**: Agents are tightly coupled; need Observer
4. **Algorithm Switching Problem**: Routing logic is hardcoded; need Strategy
5. **Your Prediction**: What patterns would solve each problem? Why?

---

## Part 2: AI Teaches Pattern Design Through Architecture

**Your Role**: Student learning architectural patterns from AI Teacher

### AI Teaching Prompt

Ask your AI companion:

> "I'm building a customer service agent system. Currently:
> - I create new agent instances everywhere (Problem: multiple managers)
> - I add new agent types by copy-pasting code (Problem: duplicated initialization)
> - Agents update each other directly by calling methods (Problem: tight coupling)
> - Routing logic is hardcoded in one function (Problem: can't switch strategies)
>
> For EACH problem, explain:
> 1. What design pattern solves it?
> 2. Show me the pattern implementation
> 3. What benefit do I get?
> 4. How do I add a new agent type without modifying existing code?
> 5. What about combining patterns—how would Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy work together?"

### Expected AI Response Summary

AI will explain:
- **Singleton**: Ensure AgentManager exists once across the system
- **Factory**: Create agents by type without knowing exact classes
- **Observer**: Agents register with EventBus; events notify all observers
- **Strategy**: Pass routing strategy to manager; swap at runtime
- **Integration**: Each pattern solves one problem; together they create flexible architecture

**AI will show architecture like**:

```python
# Singleton
class AgentManager:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Factory
class AgentFactory:
    def create(self, agent_type: str, name: str):
        if agent_type == "chat":
            return ChatAgent(name)
        elif agent_type == "ticket":
            return TicketAgent(name)

# Observer
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []
    def attach(self, observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)
    def notify(self, event):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.handle(event)

# Strategy
class RoutingStrategy:
    def route(self, sentiment: str) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Convergence Activity

After AI explains, verify understanding:

> "Walk me through how these patterns interact: AgentManager uses Factory to create agents, agents register with EventBus, EventBus notifies agents of events, and RoutingStrategy selects which agent handles each message. Explain what happens when a new agent type is added."

### Deliverable

Write 2-paragraph summary: "How Design Patterns Compose to Enable Scalable Architectures" explaining:
- What each pattern contributes
- How they work together
- Why you need all four for complete flexibility

---

## Part 3: Student Challenges AI with Complex Architecture Questions

**Your Role**: Student testing AI's understanding of pattern interactions

### Challenge Design Scenarios

Ask AI to handle these cases:

#### Challenge 1: Pattern Conflicts

> "If I use Singleton for AgentManager and Dependency Injection to pass the manager to agents, which is better? Can I use both? What problems could arise if I mix them?"

**Expected learning**: AI explains trade-offs between patterns and when to mix/match approaches.

#### Challenge 2: Pattern Composition

> "I want to add three more patterns: Mediator (for agent communication), Command (for queuing tasks), Decorator (for dynamic capabilities). How do they interact with Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy? Show the architecture diagram."

**Expected learning**: AI shows how multiple patterns compose into larger systems without conflicting.

#### Challenge 3: Testing and Patterns

> "With Singleton and Observer, testing becomes harder (global state, hidden dependencies). How would you design these patterns to be testable? Should I use Dependency Injection instead?"

**Expected learning**: AI explains testability implications of patterns and how to design for both.

### Deliverable

Document your three challenges, AI's responses, and your understanding of pattern trade-offs and composition.

## Part 5: Reflect on All Chapter 25 Concepts

**Your Role**: Educational synthesist integrating all learning

This is unique to the capstone—you'll reflect on what you've learned across all five lessons.

### Reflection Prompt

Write a comprehensive reflection document: `chapter_25_integration_reflection.md` with sections:

#### Section 1: Inheritance and MRO (Lesson 1)
Reflect on:
- How did understanding Method Resolution Order change your thinking about class hierarchies?
- When would you use single vs multiple inheritance?
- How did inheritance patterns appear in later lessons?

#### Section 2: Polymorphism and Duck Typing (Lesson 2)
Reflect on:
- What's the key insight that separates polymorphism from duck typing?
- In your multi-agent system, where did you use each approach? Why?
- How would your design differ if you HAD to use duck typing everywhere?

#### Section 3: Composition Over Inheritance (Lesson 3)
Reflect on:
- Your agents are composed from engines. How is this better than inheritance?
- What would the codebase look like if agents inherited from TicketAgent, ChatAgent, etc.?
- How did composition principles appear in your strategy and observer implementations?

#### Section 4: Special Methods and Protocols (Lesson 4)
Reflect on:
- How did special methods make your custom types feel like built-ins?
- In an agent system, where might you use __call__, __enter__/__exit__, or __iter__?
- What's the relationship between protocols and polymorphism?

#### Section 5: Design Patterns Integration (Lesson 5)
Reflect on:
- How do Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy solve fundamental OOP problems?
- Could you design your system with only some patterns? What would you lose?
- What's the relationship between design patterns and the OOP concepts from Lessons 1-4?

#### Section 6: Architectural Synthesis
Reflect on:
- In your system, inheritance is used for agent types. Composition is used for agent capabilities. Polymorphism makes routing work. Special methods make events feel natural.
- How are all these concepts working together?
- Can you trace a message through your system and identify which OOP concept is responsible at each step?
- What would break if you removed each concept?

### Deliverable

Complete `chapter_25_integration_reflection.md` with thoughtful answers to all reflection questions, demonstrating deep understanding of how all Chapter 25 concepts interconnect.

# Collections and Binary Types — Awareness Level

## What You'll Learn

- Five collection types (list, tuple, dict, set, range)
- When to use each collection
- Binary types for files and networks
- Reading collection type hints

## Understanding Collections: Containers for Multiple Values

In the previous lessons of this chapter, you learned about single data types: `int`, `str`, `bool`, and `None`. Each stores one piece of information.

But what if you need to store multiple related pieces of data together?

- A shopping list: milk, eggs, bread, cheese
- A person's contact information: name, email, phone number
- Daily temperature readings: 65°F, 68°F, 70°F, 72°F

**Collections** are Python's way of grouping related data together in one variable. Think of them as containers—each organized slightly differently depending on what you're storing and how you'll access it.

This lesson covers five main collection types plus a brief introduction to binary types. Your goal: **know they exist, understand their purpose, and recognize which one fits each situation.** The detailed methods and operations come in Chapter 18.

## Five Core Collection Types

### 1. List — Ordered, Mutable, Multiple Items

A **list** stores multiple items in a specific order. You can change, add, or remove items after creating it.

**When to use**: When you have a sequence of similar items where order matters, and you might change what's in the list.

**What it looks like:**

```python
shopping_list: list[str] = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
scores: list[int] = [95, 87, 92, 88]
mixed: list = [1, "hello", 3.14]  # Can mix types, but not recommended
```

**Real-world analogy**: A list is like a shopping list. Items are in a specific order. You can cross one off (remove), add a new item, or change one. Each position holds one item.

**Simple example:**

```python
# Create a list of student names
students: list[str] = ["Alex", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# Lists show what they are
print(students)        # Output: ['Alex', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
print(type(students))  # Output: <class 'list'>
```

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Why would you use a list instead of just writing four separate variables for four test scores? What problem does list solve?"

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, choosing list over individual variables is about communicating intent. When you write `scores: list[int]`, you're telling AI (and future maintainers): "I'm storing multiple items that might grow or change." This type hint enables AI to suggest operations like iteration, filtering, and aggregation that work on collections. Syntax is cheap—semantic intent is gold.

### 2. Tuple — Ordered, Immutable, Multiple Items

A **tuple** stores multiple items in a specific order. Once you create it, you CANNOT change it. It's fixed.

**When to use**: When you have a fixed set of related items that shouldn't change. Tuples are often used to return multiple values from functions (you'll learn about this in Chapter 20).

**What it looks like:**

```python
rgb_color: tuple[int, int, int] = (255, 0, 128)
coordinates: tuple[float, float] = (3.5, 7.2)
person_info: tuple[str, int] = ("Alex", 25)
```

**Real-world analogy**: A tuple is like a sealed envelope with specific contents. Once sealed, you can't change what's inside. You can read it, but you can't modify it.

**Simple example:**

```python
# GPS coordinates are fixed once recorded
location: tuple[float, float] = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # NYC

print(location)        # Output: (40.7128, -74.006)
print(type(location))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>
```

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Why would you choose tuple for coordinates instead of list? What does making it immutable (unchangeable) protect?"

### 3. Dictionary — Key-Value Pairs, Changeable

A **dict** (dictionary) stores data as pairs: a key and its value. Instead of accessing items by position, you look them up by name (key).

**When to use**: When you need to store related information that you'll look up by name, like a real dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its definition (value).

**What it looks like:**

```python
student: dict[str, str] = {"name": "Alex", "grade": "A"}
prices: dict[str, float] = {"apple": 1.99, "banana": 0.59, "orange": 2.49}
ages: dict[str, int] = {"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25, "Charlie": 28}
```

**Real-world analogy**: A dict is like a phone book. You don't remember that your friend's number is in position 47. You remember their name is "Alice". You look up "Alice" (the key) and find her number (the value).

**Simple example:**

```python
# Store information about a person
person: dict[str, str] = {
    "name": "Alex",
    "email": "alex@example.com",
    "city": "New York"
}

print(person)        # Output: {'name': 'Alex', 'email': 'alex@example.com', 'city': 'New York'}
print(type(person))  # Output: <class 'dict'>
```

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Why would you use a dictionary to store student records instead of a list? How does the lookup difference (by key vs. by position) change what you can do?"

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I need to store student grades for a class. Should I use `list[float]`, `dict[str, float]`, or `tuple[float, ...]`? Create examples of each and explain when each would be appropriate. Consider: Do I need to look up grades by student name? Will grades change? Is order important?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see how collection type choice depends on access patterns (by index vs. by key), mutability requirements, and ordering constraints—not arbitrary preference.

### 4. Set — Unique Values Only, Unordered

A **set** stores unique values with no duplicates. Order doesn't matter, and you can't access items by position.

**When to use**: When you need to ensure no duplicates exist, or when you need to check "is this item in my collection?" quickly. Duplicates are automatically removed.

**What it looks like:**

```python
unique_ids: set[int] = {101, 102, 103}
tags: set[str] = {"python", "coding", "ai"}
numbers: set[int] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2}  # Duplicates automatically removed
```

**Real-world analogy**: A set is like a container of unique badges. If you already have the "Python" badge, adding another "Python" badge has no effect—you still have just one. There are no duplicates.

**Simple example:**

```python
# List of product IDs (some repeated)
product_ids: set[int] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4}

print(product_ids)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
# Notice: only unique values remain; duplicates are gone
print(type(product_ids))  # Output: <class 'set'>
```

**Brief note on frozenset**: Python also has `frozenset`, which is an immutable version of set. It's less common but useful when you need a set that can't be changed.

### 5. Range — Immutable Number Sequence

A **range** generates a sequence of numbers. It's memory-efficient because it doesn't store every number—it calculates them as needed.

**When to use**: Primarily for loops (Chapter 17) and when you need a sequence of numbers without creating a list manually.

**What it looks like:**

```python
numbers = range(0, 10)    # 0 to 9
evens = range(0, 10, 2)   # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
countdown = range(5, 0, -1)  # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

**Simple example:**

```python
# Generate numbers efficiently
numbers = range(0, 5)

print(numbers)        # Output: range(0, 5)
print(type(numbers))  # Output: <class 'range'>
```

**Real-world analogy**: Range is like a recipe that generates numbers on demand, rather than a pre-made list. Instead of writing `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, you say "start at 0, go to 5 (not including 5)" and Python generates those numbers as needed.

## Collection Decision Guide

When should you use each collection? Here's a quick reference:

| Need | Collection | Why | Example |
|------|-----------|-----|---------|
| Ordered list that might change | **list** | Add/remove/modify items | `shopping: list[str]` |
| Ordered data that's fixed | **tuple** | Data integrity, function returns | `color_rgb: tuple[int, int, int]` |
| Look up values by name | **dict** | Fast lookup by key | `phone_book: dict[str, str]` |
| Unique items only | **set** | Remove duplicates automatically | `tags: set[str]` |
| Number sequence efficiently | **range** | Memory-efficient iteration | `range(0, 10)` |

## Understanding Type Hints for Collections

Type hints are especially important for collections because they tell readers (and AI partners) **what kind of data is inside**.

```python
# This reads as: "scores is a list of integers"
scores: list[int] = [95, 87, 92]

# This reads as: "prices is a dictionary with string keys and float values"
prices: dict[str, float] = {"apple": 1.99, "banana": 0.59}

# This reads as: "location is a tuple of two floats"
location: tuple[float, float] = (40.7128, -74.0060)

# This reads as: "tags is a set of strings"
tags: set[str] = {"python", "coding", "ai"}
```

**Why type hints matter for collections:**
1. **Clarity**: Anyone reading your code instantly knows what's inside
2. **AI Partnership**: When you ask Claude Code or Gemini for help, the type hints make your intent crystal clear
3. **Error Prevention**: Type hints help catch mistakes early

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, choosing the right collection type isn't about memorizing syntax—it's about communicating data structure intent. When you write `user_ids: set[int]`, you're telling AI: "these IDs must be unique, order doesn't matter, fast membership checking is important." The type hint documents your design decision, enabling better AI suggestions and preventing bugs.

## Binary Types — Brief Introduction

Beyond collections, Python has **binary types** for handling raw bytes and low-level data. You don't need to master these now, but you should know they exist and why.

### What Are Binary Types?

Binary types store data as bytes (0s and 1s) rather than as text or numbers. They're used when working with:
- Files (reading/writing images, audio, videos)
- Network communication (sending data over internet)
- Low-level operations (memory, hardware interaction)

### The Three Main Binary Types

**bytes** — Immutable binary data
- Once created, you can't change it
- Used for: reading files, network protocols, storing binary data

```python
data: bytes = b"Hello"

print(data)            # Output: b'Hello'
print(type(data))      # Output: <class 'bytes'>
```

**bytearray** — Mutable binary data
- You can change bytes after creating it
- Used for: modifying binary data, building up data incrementally

```python
mutable_data: bytearray = bytearray(b"World")

print(mutable_data)    # Output: bytearray(b'World')
print(type(mutable_data))  # Output: <class 'bytearray'>
```

**memoryview** — Efficient binary access without copying
- Advanced type for accessing binary data without making copies in memory
- Used for: high-performance file operations, large data processing

```python
data: bytes = b"Binary"
view = memoryview(data)

print(type(view))      # Output: <class 'memoryview'>
```

### Why Binary Types Exist

When you work with files or networks, data comes as raw bytes. You can't treat `b"Hello"` like a string—it's binary. These types let you:
- Read and write files correctly
- Send data over networks without corruption
- Process images, audio, and other binary formats
- Access memory efficiently

### When You'll Use Binary Types

**Advanced topic**: Binary types come into play when you:
- Read binary files (Chapter 22: Files and Data)
- Work with network communication (Part 8-9: Advanced topics)
- Process images or multimedia
- Interact with hardware or databases

**For now**: Just know they exist. You'll use them in later chapters when working with files and networks. Don't worry about the details yet.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "If I'm reading a JPG image file, why can't I use a regular `str`? Why do I need `bytes` or `bytearray`?"

## Complete Type Overview Examples

### Example 1: Different Collections for Different Jobs

```python
# STORAGE for shopping items that change
shopping: list[str] = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]

# LOOKUP for student records by ID
students: dict[str, int] = {
    "Alice": 95,
    "Bob": 87,
    "Charlie": 92
}

# FIXED coordinates that don't change
location: tuple[float, float] = (40.7128, -74.0060)

# UNIQUE tags with no duplicates
tags: set[str] = {"python", "ai", "coding"}

# NUMBERS sequence for counting
count: range = range(1, 6)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

### Example 2: Recognizing Collection Types in Code

```python
# Can you identify what each is?

data1: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
data2: dict[str, str] = {"name": "Alex", "city": "NYC"}
data3: tuple[int, str, float] = (42, "answer", 3.14)
data4: set[str] = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
data5: range = range(0, 10)

# Answer:
# data1: list — ordered, changeable sequence
# data2: dict — name-based lookups
# data3: tuple — fixed structure
# data4: set — unique items
# data5: range — number sequence
```

### Example 3: Why Type Hints Matter

```python
# CLEAR: Type hints document the structure
employees: dict[str, dict[str, str]] = {
    "E001": {"name": "Alice", "department": "Engineering"},
    "E002": {"name": "Bob", "department": "Sales"}
}

# WITHOUT type hints, the structure is hidden
employees_unclear = {
    "E001": {"name": "Alice", "department": "Engineering"},
    "E002": {"name": "Bob", "department": "Sales"}
}

# Which one is clearer to you and an AI partner?
```

## Important Notice: Deep Dive Coverage Coming

**This lesson is awareness only.** You now know:
- The five main collection types and their purpose
- When to use each type based on your data needs
- How to read type hints for collections
- That binary types exist and why they're important
- What simple examples look like

**You do NOT yet need to know:**
- How to add or remove items from collections (methods)
- How to loop through collections
- Advanced operations on each type
- How to create your own types

**These skills come next in:**
- **Chapter 18: Collections Deep Dive** — Methods and operations for list, tuple, dict, set
- **Chapter 22: Files and Data** — Where you'll actually use binary types with file I/O

When you reach those chapters, you'll return to collections and learn everything you can DO with them.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Create 10 real-world scenarios that require storing data. For each, tell me which collection type I should use (list, tuple, dict, set, or range) and why. Consider: Do I need to change the data? Do I look it up by key or position? Do I need uniqueness? Are the items in order?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see how collection type choice depends on real-world constraints, not arbitrary preference. AI will help you think through the decision-making process.

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT). These prompts deepen your understanding of collections before moving to Chapter 18.

### Prompt 1: Collection Types Comparison

```
I see four main collection types: list, tuple, dict, and set.
What is the main difference between each one?
When would I use list instead of tuple?
When would I use dict instead of list?
Create a real-world example for each.
```

**Expected outcome**: AI explains the four types with clear distinctions and real-world examples (ordered vs. unordered, mutable vs. immutable, indexed vs. key-based, duplicates vs. unique).

### Prompt 2: Collection Type Selection

```
I need to store:
1. A shopping list (might add/remove items)
2. GPS coordinates (never change after recording)
3. A phone book (look up by name)
4. A list of unique product IDs (no duplicates)

Which collection type should I use for each? Why?
```

**Expected outcome**: AI selects list, tuple, dict, and set respectively, explaining the reasoning for each choice based on mutability, access pattern, and ordering requirements.

### Prompt 3: Reading Type Hints

```
I see type hints like list[int], dict[str, float], tuple[float, float].
What do these mean? What is the part inside the square brackets?
Create three more examples and explain what each one means.
```

**Expected outcome**: AI explains that the brackets describe what's inside the collection (element type), with clear examples showing what each means.

### Prompt 4: Collection Operations Preview

```
I know collections exist and why they matter. What operations can I perform
with these collections? What can I DO with lists, dicts, sets, and tuples?
```

**Expected outcome**: AI lists operations like adding items to lists, removing items, looping through collections, checking membership, accessing items.

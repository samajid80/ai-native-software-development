# Chapter 29: CPython and GIL

Master the CPython interpreter and Python's revolutionary free-threading capabilities—the biggest change in Python's 30-year history.

For three decades, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevented true parallel execution of threads. Multi-threaded Python programs could only execute one thread at a time, limiting performance on multi-core machines. In October 2025, Python 3.14 made free-threading production-ready, reducing overhead from 40% to just 5–10% and enabling TRUE multi-core parallelism.

This chapter teaches three critical dimensions: CPython's architecture and how it executes your code, the GIL's evolution from constraint to optional feature, and building production multi-agent AI systems with true parallel reasoning. You'll understand when to use threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, or free-threaded Python, design benchmarks to validate your choices, and build a complete multi-agent system demonstrating 2–4x performance gains on multi-core machines.

**Why this matters for AI-native development**: Multi-agent systems can now reason in parallel on separate CPU cores, not just pseudo-concurrently. A 4-agent system on a 4-core machine achieves genuine parallelism—the exact pattern modern AI applications need.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand CPython architecture** — Explain what CPython is and how it differs from alternative implementations (PyPy, Jython), describe the execution pipeline from source code to bytecode to interpreter, and identify when CPython's design choices matter for performance
- **Master GIL evolution and free-threading** — Explain traditional GIL behavior and why it exists, describe Python 3.14's free-threaded mode (installation, detection, runtime control), and compare performance characteristics (5–10% overhead vs 2–10x gains)
- **Make informed concurrency decisions** — Distinguish CPU-bound from I/O-bound workloads, choose the correct approach (threading, multiprocessing, free-threaded Python, or asyncio), and design benchmarks to validate concurrency choices
- **Build AI-native systems with true parallelism** — Implement multi-agent AI systems demonstrating true parallel reasoning, build benchmarking dashboards comparing concurrency approaches, and connect free-threading to production deployment patterns (Ray, Kubernetes preview)
- **Apply the AI-native learning pattern** — Describe intent using type hints and clear code structure, explore concepts with AI co-reasoning partners (Claude Code/Gemini CLI), and validate understanding through experiments and tests

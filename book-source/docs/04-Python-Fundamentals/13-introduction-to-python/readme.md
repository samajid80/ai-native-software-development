# Chapter 13: Introduction to Modern Python

You've spent Chapters 1–12 learning the philosophy and tools of AI-Driven Development. Now it's time to apply that philosophy to Python programming—the language that powers modern AI applications and enables you to describe your intent clearly so AI agents can help you build.

This chapter isn't about memorizing Python syntax—it's about understanding Python as a tool for describing intent that AI agents can execute. You'll install Python, write your first typed variables and programs, and build an interactive capstone project that integrates everything you've learned. Most importantly, you'll understand how to use Python with AI collaboration: you describe what you want your code to do (using type hints and clear specifications), your AI partner helps you explore and implement, and you validate the results.

This chapter applies the AI-Native Learning methodology throughout: you'll explore concepts with your AI companion (Claude Code or Gemini CLI), validate your understanding through hands-on practice, and learn from errors with AI's help.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **What Is Python?** Understand Python as the language of AI-driven development and why it matters for building AI agents
- **Installing Python 3.14+** Set up a working Python environment on Windows, Mac, or Linux with AI assistance for troubleshooting
- **Variables and Type Hints** Create typed variables that describe intent clearly, preparing for specification-first thinking
- **Basic Syntax and Programs** Write and run Python programs using indentation, comments, print statements, and f-strings
- **Capstone Project** Build an interactive program that collects and validates user information, demonstrating all Chapter 13 concepts

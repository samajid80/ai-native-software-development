# Understanding Metaclasses – The Classes That Create Classes

## Why This Matters

Before you go further in Python, you've been writing classes like this:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
```

This is so natural, it feels like the fundamental building block. But have you ever wondered: **who creates the class itself?** Who runs the code that makes `Dog` into a class object?

In Python, the answer is: **a metaclass**. And the default metaclass is `type`. This lesson reveals that mystery—and shows you that class creation is not magic, it's just normal Python code.

Here's the crucial insight: Once you understand how Python creates classes, you unlock the ability to customize that process. Metaclasses let you intercept class creation and add validation, automatic registration, or behavior that would be impossible with regular code.

**This lesson is foundational.** You'll learn the mechanism first, then see practical applications in Lesson 2. Many developers skip this material and call it "advanced magic." You won't. You'll understand the machinery, and that knowledge will make framework source code (Django, SQLAlchemy) readable to you.

## Core Concept 1: What Is a Metaclass?

A **metaclass** is a class whose instances are classes. Think about the hierarchy:

- **Object**: An instance of class `Dog` (a dog instance)
- **Class**: A blueprint (class `Dog` itself)
- **Metaclass**: The blueprint that defines how `Dog` the class is created

Every class in Python is an instance of some metaclass. When you write:

```python
class Dog:
    pass
```

Python is actually doing something like:

```python
# Pseudocode (conceptual, not executable):
# class Dog → type.__call__() → creates Dog instance of type
# Dog = type.__call__(...)  # Simplified, but conceptually correct
```

The **default metaclass for all classes is `type`**. Let's prove it:

```python
class Dog:
    pass

print(type(Dog))  # Output: <class 'type'>
print(type(3))    # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type([]))   # Output: <class 'list'>
```

Notice: `type(Dog)` returns `type`, not `<class 'Dog'>`. The class object itself is an instance of `type`.

**This is the first big insight**: *In Python, classes are objects too. And the class that creates them is called a metaclass.*

## Core Concept 2: The `type` Metaclass

The `type` metaclass is special. It's the default metaclass for every class you create, and it can also act as a **class factory**—a function that creates classes dynamically.

When you use `type()` as a function, the signature is:

```python
# type(name: str, bases: tuple[type, ...], namespace: dict[str, object]) -> type
```

**Parameters**:
- `name`: The class name (string)
- `bases`: Tuple of parent classes (e.g., `(object,)` or `(SomeParent,)`)
- `namespace`: Dictionary of class attributes and methods

**Example: Creating a Class Dynamically with `type()`**

```python
# Specification Reference: Demonstrate type() as class factory
# Prompt: Show me how to create a class using type() with name, bases, and dict

# Define class attributes and methods in a dictionary
class_attributes: dict[str, object] = {
    'species': 'Canis familiaris',  # Class variable
    '__init__': lambda self, name: setattr(self, 'name', name),
    'bark': lambda self: f"{self.name} says woof!",
}

# Create the class using type()
Dog = type('Dog', (object,), class_attributes)

# Use it like a normal class
my_dog = Dog('Buddy')
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
print(type(Dog))  # Output: <class 'type'>
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. ✅ Class creation succeeded without using `class` keyword
2. ✅ Instance created and methods work
3. ✅ `type(Dog)` confirms it's an instance of `type`

This is powerful. It means you can create classes programmatically—at runtime, with dynamic names and methods. This is how frameworks like Django build model classes from database schema.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Why would you ever need to create a class dynamically with `type()` instead of just writing `class Dog:`? Show me a real-world scenario where dynamic class creation is necessary."

## Core Concept 3: How Class Creation Works (The Flow)

When you write:

```python
class MyClass:
    attr = 42
```

Python executes this flow:

1. **Python evaluates the class body** (namespace): Code inside the class block runs, populating a namespace dict
2. **`type.__new__()` is called** with (name, bases, namespace): Creates the class object
3. **`type.__init__()` is called**: Initializes the class object
4. **The class object is returned** and assigned to the name `MyClass`

This is also what happens when you call `type('MyClass', (), {'attr': 42})`. The flow is identical.

**Why this matters**: If you create a custom metaclass (inheriting from `type`), you can intercept steps 2 and 3. You can inspect the namespace before the class is created, raise errors if validation fails, or automatically register the class somewhere.

## Core Concept 4: Custom Metaclass Syntax

To create a custom metaclass, you inherit from `type`:

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    """Custom metaclass that intercepts class creation."""

    def __new__(mcs, name: str, bases: tuple, namespace: dict):
        # Intercept and customize class creation
        print(f"Creating class: {name}")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)
```

Then use it:

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    """Custom metaclass that intercepts class creation."""
    def __new__(mcs, name: str, bases: tuple, namespace: dict):
        print(f"Creating class: {name}")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass
# Output: Creating class: MyClass
```

**Key points**:
- Use `metaclass=MyMeta` syntax (not inheritance)
- The first parameter in `__new__()` is `mcs` (metaclass), not `cls`
- Call `super().__new__()` to actually create the class

**Example: Basic Custom Metaclass**

```python
# Specification Reference: Create a custom metaclass that logs class creation
# Prompt: Create a metaclass that prints a message when a class is created

class LoggingMeta(type):
    """Metaclass that logs every class creation."""

    def __new__(mcs, name: str, bases: tuple, namespace: dict) -> type:
        """Intercept class creation and log it."""
        print(f"[METACLASS LOG] Creating class '{name}' with bases {bases}")
        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)
        return cls

class Animal(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    """Base class using LoggingMeta."""
    def speak(self) -> str:
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal, metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    """Dog class also uses LoggingMeta."""
    def speak(self) -> str:
        return "Woof!"

# Output:
# [METACLASS LOG] Creating class 'Animal' with bases (<class 'object'>,)
# [METACLASS LOG] Creating class 'Dog' with bases (<class 'Animal'>,)

# Verify it works like normal
dog = Dog()
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. ✅ Metaclass logs class creation at definition time (not instantiation time)
2. ✅ Classes created with metaclass work normally
3. ✅ Inheritance chain preserved (Dog inherits from Animal)

## Core Concept 5: Metaclass `__new__()` vs `__init__()`

A metaclass has two key methods:

- **`__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)`**: Creates the class object. It's where you can modify the namespace, raise errors, or build the class conditionally.
- **`__init__(cls, name, bases, namespace)`**: Called after the class is created. Use it for post-creation setup (registering the class, initializing class variables, etc.).

**Example: Validation Metaclass**

```python
# Specification Reference: Metaclass that validates required attributes
# Prompt: Create a metaclass that raises error if class doesn't have a 'version' attribute

class VersionedMeta(type):
    """Metaclass that enforces all classes have a 'version' attribute."""

    required_attributes: list[str] = ['version']

    def __new__(mcs, name: str, bases: tuple, namespace: dict) -> type:
        """Validate required attributes before class creation."""
        # Skip validation for the metaclass itself
        if name == 'VersionedMeta':
            return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

        # Check for required attributes
        for attr in mcs.required_attributes:
            if attr not in namespace:
                raise AttributeError(
                    f"Class '{name}' must define '{attr}' attribute. "
                    f"Missing attributes: {set(mcs.required_attributes) - set(namespace.keys())}"
                )

        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

# This works - has 'version'
class MyLibrary(metaclass=VersionedMeta):
    version = "1.0.0"
    description = "A useful library"

# This fails - missing 'version'
try:
    class BrokenLibrary(metaclass=VersionedMeta):
        description = "Missing version"
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Output: Error: Class 'BrokenLibrary' must define 'version' attribute...
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. ✅ Class with required attribute: created successfully
2. ✅ Class without required attribute: raises AttributeError at class definition time (not instantiation)
3. ✅ Error message is clear about what's missing

This is your first real metaclass pattern: **attribute validation**. Lesson 2 builds on this with registration, singleton, and framework patterns.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, you don't memorize metaclass syntax patterns—you understand WHEN class creation needs customization. Your job: recognize "this validation must happen before any instance exists" moments. AI handles the metaclass mechanics; you provide the strategic insight.

####  🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Create a metaclass that ensures all methods in a class have type hints. Then explain why this validation must happen at class creation time instead of at runtime."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand that metaclasses enforce architectural constraints before code even runs, making certain bugs impossible.

## Core Concept 6: Understanding Method Resolution Order (MRO) with Metaclasses

When a metaclass is involved, Python follows a specific MRO:

1. Check the class itself
2. Check the metaclass
3. Check parent classes of the metaclass

This matters because if you define a method in a metaclass, you can control behavior across all classes using that metaclass.

**Example: Understanding MRO**

```python
class Meta(type):
    def class_method(cls) -> str:
        """This is a method on the metaclass."""
        return "Called on metaclass"

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# You can call methods defined in the metaclass on the class itself:
print(MyClass.class_method())  # Output: Called on metaclass

# But not on instances:
obj = MyClass()
# obj.class_method()  # AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'class_method'
```

When you define a method in a metaclass, that method is available on the class, not on instances. This is powerful for adding "class-level APIs" that apply to all classes using the metaclass.

## Core Concept 7: When to Use Metaclasses vs When NOT To

This is critical. Metaclasses are powerful but also dangerous (they make code complex). Here's when each is appropriate:

**Use metaclasses when you need to**:
1. Customize how classes are created (validation, registration)
2. Implement framework patterns (like Django ORM)
3. Enforce class structure across all subclasses
4. Automatically collect information from class definitions

**Don't use metaclasses when**:
1. A simple class method or decorator would work
2. You need to modify instances (use `__init__()` instead)
3. You want to add behavior to objects (use inheritance or composition)

A common mistake: Using a metaclass to add a method to all instances. That's what class inheritance is for.

**Example: Metaclass vs Decorator**

```python
# Specification Reference: Compare metaclass vs decorator approach
# Prompt: Create a metaclass vs decorator that validates methods have docstrings

# Approach 1: Using a decorator (simpler, usually better)
def require_docstrings(cls):
    """Decorator that validates all methods have docstrings."""
    for name, method in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(method) and not name.startswith('_'):
            if not method.__doc__:
                raise ValueError(f"Method '{name}' must have a docstring")
    return cls

# Approach 2: Using a metaclass (more complex, but works at class creation time)
class DocstringMeta(type):
    """Metaclass that validates all methods have docstrings."""

    def __new__(mcs, name: str, bases: tuple, namespace: dict) -> type:
        for attr_name, attr_value in namespace.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('_'):
                if not attr_value.__doc__:
                    raise ValueError(f"Method '{attr_name}' must have a docstring")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

# Using the decorator:
@require_docstrings
class GoodAPI(metaclass=type):
    def fetch_data(self) -> str:
        """Fetch data from remote source."""
        return "data"

# Using the metaclass:
class GoodAPI2(metaclass=DocstringMeta):
    def fetch_data(self) -> str:
        """Fetch data from remote source."""
        return "data"

# Both work the same way. The decorator is simpler and more readable.
```

**Key insight**: Choose the simplest approach that solves your problem. Metaclasses are powerful, but decorators, inheritance, and `__init__()` validation cover most use cases.

## Core Concept 8: Real-World Metaclass Preview

Where are metaclasses actually used? In frameworks:

- **Django ORM**: `Model` metaclass collects field definitions from class attributes
- **SQLAlchemy**: `DeclarativeMeta` metaclass builds SQL schemas from Python classes
- **Pydantic** (v1): Metaclass validates data at class definition time

In Lesson 2, you'll implement patterns similar to Django and SQLAlchemy. For now, just know: **metaclasses let frameworks turn Python class definitions into database models**.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

You now understand:

1. **Metaclasses are classes that create classes** — Every Python class is an instance of a metaclass (default: `type`)
2. **`type()` is a class factory** — Create classes dynamically with `type(name, bases, dict)`
3. **Class creation has a flow** — `__new__()` creates the class object, `__init__()` initializes it
4. **Custom metaclasses intercept creation** — Inherit from `type` and override `__new__()` to customize
5. **Validation at class creation time** — Metaclasses can enforce requirements before a class is usable
6. **MRO matters with metaclasses** — Methods defined in a metaclass become class-level APIs
7. **Use sparingly** — Metaclasses solve framework design problems; most code uses simpler approaches
8. **Framework patterns ahead** — Lesson 2 shows registration, singleton, and framework-like patterns

The big insight: **Class creation is not magic. It's just Python code that you can customize.**

## Part 1: Experience Class Creation by Tracing `type()`

**Your Role**: Active experimenter discovering the class creation mechanism with AI collaboration

Before you can understand metaclasses, you need to see that classes are objects like any other. You'll discover Python's type system through AI-guided exploration.

### Discovery Exercise: Exploring the Type Hierarchy with AI

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Discovering the Type Hierarchy

> "I want to understand Python's type system. Help me explore:
> 1. Run `type(42)`, `type("hello")`, `type([1,2,3])` - what do these return?
> 2. Now run `type(int)`, `type(str)`, `type(list)` - what's different?
> 3. Run `type(type)` - why does this return `type` itself?
> 4. For a custom class I define (`class Dog: pass`), what does `type(Dog)` return?
> 5. Show me a diagram: objects → types → what comes next?
>
> Explain what this reveals about Python's object model."

**Expected Understanding**: AI will show you that EVERYTHING in Python is an object, including classes themselves. All classes are instances of `type`, which is the "metaclass" that creates classes. You'll see the hierarchy: `instances → classes → type`.

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Understanding "Everything is an Object"

> "You showed me that:
> - `type(42)` returns `int` (42 is an instance of int)
> - `type(int)` returns `type` (int is an instance of type!)
> - `type(type)` returns `type` (type is an instance of itself)
>
> Explain the implications:
> 1. If classes are objects, who creates them?
> 2. What does it mean that `type` is its own type?
> 3. Why is this called a 'metaclass'?
> 4. Show me what happens when Python executes `class Dog: pass` - what actually runs?"

**Expected Understanding**: AI will explain that `type` is the "class of all classes" (a metaclass). When you write `class Dog: pass`, Python calls `type` to CREATE the Dog class object. This is the foundation for understanding metaclasses.

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Previewing Metaclass Power

> "Now that I understand `type` creates classes, show me:
> 1. Can I create a class WITHOUT using `class` keyword? (Using `type()` directly)
> 2. What if I want to customize class creation? (Print when classes are made)
> 3. Show me a simple custom metaclass that does something during class creation
> 4. Why would I ever need this in real code?
>
> Give me a concrete example where metaclasses solve a real problem."

**Expected Understanding**: AI will show you how to create classes dynamically with `type()`, then introduce a simple custom metaclass. You'll see that metaclasses let you intercept and customize class creation - useful for validation, registration, and framework design.

## Part 2: Learn the Metaclass Hierarchy

**Your Role**: Student learning from AI Teacher

Now that you've observed the pattern, ask AI to teach you the conceptual model.

### AI Teaching Prompt

Ask your AI companion (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT):

> "I've discovered that:
> - `type(42)` returns `int`
> - `type(int)` returns `type`
> - `type(Dog)` returns `type` (for any class I define)
>
> Explain:
> 1. Why is `type` the type of all classes?
> 2. What does it mean for `type` to be its own type: `type(type) == type`?
> 3. Draw a diagram showing this hierarchy: objects → classes → metaclasses
> 4. How does this enable customizing class creation?"

### What You'll Learn from AI

**Expected AI Response** (summary):
- **`type` is a metaclass**: It's the factory that creates all classes
- **Metaclass hierarchy**: Every class is an instance of some metaclass; all normal classes use `type` by default
- **Self-reference**: `type` is both a metaclass and an instance of itself (Python's bootstrap)
- **Customization opportunity**: By creating a metaclass (subclass of `type`), you can intercept class creation

### Convergence Activity

After AI explains, **test your understanding by having AI show you code**:

Ask AI: "Show me a simple custom metaclass that prints a message whenever a class is created with it. Demonstrate how it differs from a regular class."

**Expected AI Response**:
```python
class PrintingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
        print(f"Creating class: {name}")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

class MyClass(metaclass=PrintingMeta):
    pass
# Output: Creating class: MyClass
```

**Your follow-up**: Ask AI to explain WHEN the print statement executes—at class definition time or at instance creation time? Why?

### Deliverable

Write 2-paragraph summary in your notes:
1. Explain the class hierarchy in your own words (objects → classes → metaclasses)
2. Explain what "customizing class creation" means and why you'd want to do it

---

## Part 3: Challenge AI with Edge Cases

**Your Role**: Student teaching AI by finding boundaries of understanding

Now reverse the roles. You'll ask AI questions that test its understanding of metaclasses and class creation.

### Challenge Design Pattern

Create scenarios where AI must:
1. Predict what happens at class definition time vs instance creation
2. Trace through metaclass calls in order
3. Identify differences between regular methods, class methods, and metaclass methods

### Challenge 1: When Does Metaclass `__new__()` Execute?

**Your prompt to AI**:
> "Here's code with a metaclass and two classes:
>
> ```python
> class CountingMeta(type):
>     call_count = 0
>
>     def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
>         CountingMeta.call_count += 1
>         print(f"__new__ called (count: {CountingMeta.call_count})")
>         return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)
>
> class ClassA(metaclass=CountingMeta):
>     pass
>
> class ClassB(metaclass=CountingMeta):
>     pass
>
> a = ClassA()
> b = ClassB()
> print(f'Final count: {CountingMeta.call_count}')
> ```
>
> Without running this code, predict:
> - How many times will `__new__` be called?
> - What will the final count be?
> - When does it increment (during class definition, instance creation, or both)?"

**Expected AI Response**:
- `__new__` called 2 times (once for ClassA, once for ClassB)
- Final count: 2
- Increments only at class definition time, not at instance creation

**Your follow-up**: "Now predict what happens if ClassB inherits from ClassA. Will `__new__` be called a third time? Why or why not?"

### Challenge 2: Metaclass Methods vs Instance Methods

**Your prompt to AI**:
> "In a metaclass, when you define a method, what's the difference between:
>
> ```python
> class MyMeta(type):
>     def some_method(self):  # Line A
>         return "metaclass method"
>
> class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
>     def some_method(self):  # Line B
>         return "instance method"
>
> obj = MyClass()
> ```
>
> Which method gets called by each statement?
> - `MyClass.some_method()`
> - `obj.some_method()`
> - `MyMeta.some_method(MyClass)`
>
> Explain how Python finds the right method in each case."

**Expected learning**: AI will explain that metaclass methods operate on classes (not instances), while instance methods operate on instances. The method resolution order (MRO) is different.

### Challenge 3: Can You Modify a Class After It's Created?

**Your prompt to AI**:
> "Suppose a metaclass's `__new__()` modifies the namespace before creating the class:
>
> ```python
> class CapitalizeMeta(type):
>     def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
>         # Capitalize all method names
>         new_namespace = {}
>         for key, value in namespace.items():
>             if callable(value) and not key.startswith('_'):
>                 new_namespace[key.upper()] = value
>            else:
>                 new_namespace[key] = value
>         return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, new_namespace)
>
> class MyAPI(metaclass=CapitalizeMeta):
>     def fetch_data(self):
>         return "data"
> ```
>
> After the class is created, which method name exists: `fetch_data()` or `FETCH_DATA()`? Why?"

**Deliverable**: In your notes, document three challenging scenarios you posed to AI, record AI's predictions, then verify by running code. Did AI understand metaclass timing correctly?

### Validation Exercise: Test Your Metaclass Mental Model

After AI generates the reference, validate your understanding with these prompts:

#### 🤝 CoLearning Convergence - Testing Edge Cases

> "Test my metaclass understanding with these scenarios:
>
> **Scenario 1**: I have `class A(metaclass=Meta1)` and `class B(A)`. Does B use Meta1 or type?
>
> **Scenario 2**: If I define a method in a metaclass, can I call it on class instances? Why?
>
> **Scenario 3**: Can a metaclass modify methods AFTER the class is created? Show example.
>
> For each scenario, explain the reasoning using the class creation timeline."

**Expected Outcome**: AI will walk you through metaclass inheritance, method resolution, and timing - reinforcing your mental model.

Here's the reference structure AI should generate:

# Metaclass Understanding Reference
*Chapter 26, Lesson 1*

## What is a Metaclass?

A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes.

**Hierarchy** (from simplest to most abstract):
- Object instance: `dog = Dog()` (instance of class Dog)
- Class: `Dog` (instance of metaclass type)
- Metaclass: `type` (the metaclass that creates Dog)

**Visual hierarchy**:
```
object instance (dog) ──is instance of──> Dog (class) ──is instance of──> type (metaclass)
```

## The Default Metaclass: `type`

Every class you define uses `type` as its metaclass by default.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

print(type(MyClass))  # Output: <class 'type'>
```

This means Python is doing something like:
```python
MyClass = type('MyClass', (object,), {...})  # Simplified
```

## Custom Metaclasses

To create a custom metaclass:

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
        # mcs = metaclass (MyMeta)
        # name = class name (string)
        # bases = tuple of parent classes
        # namespace = dict of class attributes and methods
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass
```

**Key points**:
- Inherit from `type`
- Override `__new__()` to customize class creation
- Use `metaclass=MyMeta` syntax (not inheritance)
- `__new__()` first parameter is `mcs` (metaclass), not `cls`

## Class Creation Timeline

When you write:
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis"
    def speak(self): return "Woof!"
```

Python executes this flow:

1. **Class body executes**: Code inside the class block runs
2. **Namespace collected**: `{'species': 'Canis', 'speak': <function>}`
3. **`type.__new__()` called**: Creates the class object
4. **`type.__init__()` called**: Initializes the class
5. **Class assigned to name**: `Dog = ...`

If a custom metaclass is used, steps 3-4 use your metaclass's methods instead.

**Important**: Metaclass `__new__()` runs at CLASS DEFINITION TIME, not instance creation time.

## When to Use Metaclasses

**Use when you need to**:
- Customize how classes are created
- Validate class structure at definition time
- Auto-register classes in a registry
- Implement framework patterns (Django, SQLAlchemy)
- Enforce architectural constraints across all subclasses

**Don't use when**:
- A decorator would work
- You're modifying instances (use `__init__()`)
- You're adding methods to instances (use inheritance)

## Metaclass vs Decorator: Quick Decision Guide

**Metaclass**: Works at class definition time, shapes the class itself
**Decorator**: Works on the class after it's created, can modify the class

Usually decorators are simpler and more readable. Use metaclasses when you need to customize the class creation process itself.

## Common Metaclass Patterns

### Pattern 1: Logging Class Creation
```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
        print(f"[LOG] Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    pass
# Output: [LOG] Creating class MyClass
```

### Pattern 2: Validating Required Attributes
```python
class ValidatingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
        if 'version' not in namespace:
            raise AttributeError(f"Class {name} must define 'version'")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)

class GoodClass(metaclass=ValidatingMeta):
    version = "1.0"
    # Success!

class BadClass(metaclass=ValidatingMeta):
    # Error: Class BadClass must define 'version'
```

## Testing Your Understanding

**Question 1**: What is `type(type)`?
- Answer: `type` (type is an instance of itself)

**Question 2**: When does metaclass `__new__()` execute?
- Answer: At class definition time, not instance creation

**Question 3**: How do you use a custom metaclass?
- Answer: `class ClassName(metaclass=MyMeta):`

**Question 4**: How is a metaclass different from a regular class?
- Answer: A metaclass's instances are classes (not objects); a regular class's instances are objects
```

### Deliverable

## Try With AI

What happens when you call type(type) and why is type an instance of itself?

**🔍 Explore Class Creation:**
> "Explain the class creation timeline when I define class MyAgent. What happens at definition time vs instantiation? Show when metaclass __new__ executes versus class __init__."

**🎯 Practice Custom Metaclasses:**
> "Create a metaclass that validates all agent classes must define a process() method. Show what error appears if I forget process(). Explain why this catches errors earlier than runtime checks."

**🧪 Test Metaclass Inheritance:**
> "Create BaseAgentMeta that logs creation. If ChatAgent uses BaseAgentMeta and SpecialChatAgent inherits ChatAgent, what gets logged? Walk through the metaclass resolution order."

**🚀 Apply to Framework Design:**
> "Design a metaclass registry pattern where all agent classes auto-register themselves in a global directory when defined. Show how this eliminates manual registration code and enables plugin architectures."

# Lesson 5: List Comprehensions — Transforming Data

You've mastered creating, modifying, and sorting lists. Now comes one of Python's most elegant features: **list comprehensions**. They transform lists in a single line that reads almost like English: "a list of X for each Y in Z, if condition."

In professional Python code, comprehensions appear everywhere. They're concise, readable (when written well), and often faster than traditional loops. But here's the key insight: **clarity trumps cleverness**. A 5-line loop that's easy to understand beats a 1-line comprehension that makes your teammates pause.

Let's learn how to write them, when to use them, and—critically—when a regular loop is the better choice.

## From Loops to Comprehensions: The Transformation

You already know how to transform data with loops:

```python
# Traditional approach: start with empty list, append items
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squares_loop: list[int] = []
for x in numbers:
    squares_loop.append(x ** 2)

print(squares_loop)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

This is clear and explicit: create an empty list, iterate over numbers, append each squared value. But Python offers a shorter way to express this exact idea:

```python
# Comprehension approach: transform in one line
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squares_comp: list[int] = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]

print(squares_comp)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Both produce identical results. The second is a **list comprehension**—a syntactic shortcut for creating a new list by transforming an existing one.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain the mental transformation from a for-loop with `append()` to a list comprehension. What parts of the loop map to what parts of the comprehension syntax?"

This helps you see the structural connection so comprehensions don't feel magical.

## Understanding Comprehension Syntax

A list comprehension has **three essential parts**:

```
[expression   for   item   in   iterable]
  ^1           ^2   ^3     ^4   ^5
```

1. **Expression** — What gets added to the new list (e.g., `x ** 2`)
2. **`for` keyword** — Signals iteration starts
3. **Iteration variable** — Holds one item at a time (e.g., `x`)
4. **`in` keyword** — Connects to the source
5. **Iterable** — The source to iterate over (e.g., `numbers`)

Let's trace through an example:

```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares: list[int] = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
```

Execution:
- **Iteration 1**: `x = 1` → expression `1 ** 2 = 1` → add to result
- **Iteration 2**: `x = 2` → expression `2 ** 2 = 4` → add to result
- **Iteration 3**: `x = 3` → expression `3 ** 2 = 9` → add to result
- And so on...

**Result**: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`

Notice: the expression runs for each item in the iterable, and the result of each expression becomes an element in the new list.

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize the syntax—you understand the intent: "I want to transform each item from a source list." The syntax is just Python's way of expressing that idea concisely. When syntax feels confusing, ask AI: "Break down this comprehension step-by-step."

### Exercise 1: Writing Simple Comprehensions

Write a comprehension for each transformation. Check your type hints.

1. **Double each number**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. **Extract first letters**: `['a', 'b', 'c']` from `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`
3. **Convert to uppercase**: `['HELLO', 'WORLD']` from `['hello', 'world']`

**Your turn** — try these before looking at the solutions:

```python
# 1. Double numbers
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled: list[int] = [n * 2 for n in numbers]

# 2. Extract first letters
fruits: list[str] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
first_letters: list[str] = [fruit[0] for fruit in fruits]

# 3. Convert to uppercase
words: list[str] = ["hello", "world"]
uppercase: list[str] = [word.upper() for word in words]
```

## Adding Conditions: Filtering with `if`

Now for a powerful variation: **filtering**. Add an `if` condition to include only items that match:

```
[expression   for   item   in   iterable   if   condition]
```

Example — keep only even numbers:

```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

evens: list[int] = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

print(evens)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The `if` condition acts as a **gate**: items that pass the condition are included; others are filtered out.

**Execution**:
- `n = 1`: `1 % 2 == 0`? No → skip
- `n = 2`: `2 % 2 == 0`? Yes → include `2`
- `n = 3`: `3 % 2 == 0`? No → skip
- `n = 4`: `4 % 2 == 0`? Yes → include `4`
- And so on...

**Result**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

**Key insight**: The condition evaluates **before** the expression is added. If the condition is false, that item is skipped entirely.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "I have a list of words. Write a comprehension that keeps only words that start with a vowel. Then explain the condition you used and how it filters the list."

**Expected Outcome**: You understand how to write string conditions in comprehensions and see how the `if` gate works conceptually.

### Exercise 2: Filtering with Comprehensions

1. **Keep numbers greater than 5**: From `[2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3]`, get `[7, 9]`
2. **Keep strings longer than 3 characters**: From `['it', 'hello', 'ok', 'python']`, get `['hello', 'python']`
3. **Keep only positive numbers**: From `[-5, 3, -1, 8, -2, 0, 6]`, get `[3, 8, 6]`

```python
# 1. Numbers > 5
numbers: list[int] = [2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3]
above_five: list[int] = [n for n in numbers if n > 5]

# 2. Words longer than 3 characters
words: list[str] = ["it", "hello", "ok", "python"]
long_words: list[str] = [w for w in words if len(w) > 3]

# 3. Positive numbers
numbers: list[int] = [-5, 3, -1, 8, -2, 0, 6]
positive: list[int] = [n for n in numbers if n > 0]
```

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> When your comprehension gets hard to read (many characters, complex condition), use Claude Code to split it into a traditional loop. Ask: "Make this comprehension into a for-loop that's easier to understand." Your AI will refactor it, and you can choose whichever version is clearer for your team.

## Combining Expression and Filtering

You can transform **and** filter in one comprehension:

```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Keep only even numbers, then double them
evens_doubled: list[int] = [n * 2 for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

print(evens_doubled)  # [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
```

Order matters: the `if` condition **filters first**, then the expression is applied to remaining items.

**Execution**:
- Filter: keep `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
- Transform: apply `* 2` → `[4, 8, 12, 16, 20]`

This is very Pythonic and concise. But remember: **clarity is king**. If this makes someone pause during code review, consider splitting it:

```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# More explicit version (easier to read and debug)
evens: list[int] = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
evens_doubled: list[int] = [n * 2 for n in evens]
```

Both are correct. The second is just more readable and easier to test independently.

### Exercise 3: Transform and Filter

1. **Square only odd numbers**: From `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, get `[1, 9, 25]`
2. **Uppercase only words longer than 4 characters**: From `['hi', 'hello', 'hey', 'python']`, get `['HELLO', 'PYTHON']`

```python
# 1. Square odd numbers
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
odd_squares: list[int] = [n ** 2 for n in numbers if n % 2 != 0]

# 2. Uppercase long words
words: list[str] = ["hi", "hello", "hey", "python"]
long_upper: list[str] = [w.upper() for w in words if len(w) > 4]
```

## A Word on Readability: Clarity Trumps Cleverness

Comprehensions are beautiful when they're simple. But Python developers sometimes get carried away:

```python
# Nested comprehension with complex logic — AVOID THIS
data: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result: list[int] = [[y * 2 for y in range(x)] for x in data if x % 2 == 0]
```

This is syntactically correct but difficult to understand at a glance. It combines:
- Nested loops (a comprehension inside another comprehension)
- Multiple conditions
- Complex expressions

**Professional approach**: When you can't read your comprehension in one breath, refactor to a loop.

```python
data: list[int] = [2, 3, 4, 5]

# More readable version
result: list[list[int]] = []
for x in data:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        row: list[int] = [y * 2 for y in range(x)]
        result.append(row)
```

This is longer but tells the story clearly: "For each number in data, if it's even, create a list of doubled values from 0 to that number."

**Rule of thumb**:
- **Simple comprehension** (single line, easy to read): Use it
- **Complex comprehension** (nested loops, multiple conditions): Use a traditional loop instead
- **When in doubt**: Ask your AI and your team. A 4-line loop beats a 1-line mystery.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Is this comprehension readable? `[str(x*2) for x in range(10) if x % 3 == 0 and x > 2]` If not, rewrite it as a for-loop and explain why the loop is clearer."

## Brief Introduction to Nested Comprehensions

For completeness: you can put a comprehension inside another comprehension. But we're not diving deep here—focus on simple, readable comprehensions first.

```python
# Nested comprehension: create a matrix (list of lists)
matrix: list[list[int]] = [[i * j for j in range(1, 4)] for i in range(1, 4)]

# Equivalent (more readable) traditional loop
matrix: list[list[int]] = []
for i in range(1, 4):
    row: list[int] = []
    for j in range(1, 4):
        row.append(i * j)
    matrix.append(row)
```

Both create:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [2, 4, 6],
 [3, 6, 9]]
```

The traditional loop is much clearer. Use it.

**Key lesson**: Nested comprehensions exist, but they're often harder to debug and maintain. Master simple comprehensions first. Save nested ones for cases where the intent is crystal clear (rare).

## Try With AI: Comprehension Mastery Challenge

You've learned list comprehension syntax `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`. Now master when to use comprehensions vs. loops by building data transformations—with AI as your readability judge.

### Part 1: Convert Loop to Comprehension (Your Turn First)

**Before asking AI**, convert these for loops to list comprehensions:

**Challenge 1**: Square even numbers
```python
# Loop version
squares: list[int] = []
for n in range(1, 11):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        squares.append(n ** 2)

# Your comprehension version:
squares: list[int] = ???
```

**Challenge 2**: Extract first letters
```python
names: list[str] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
# Your comprehension: first letter of each name
initials: list[str] = ???
```

**Your task**:
1. Write both comprehensions
2. Predict the output
3. Decide: Is comprehension MORE readable than the loop?

---

### Part 2: AI Explains Comprehension Patterns (Discovery)

Share your comprehensions with AI:

> "Here are my comprehensions: [paste code]. For each:
> 1. Is the syntax correct?
> 2. Trace execution step-by-step (show intermediate values)
> 3. Which pattern does it use: filter-only, transform-only, or filter+transform?
> 4. Would YOU use a comprehension here or a loop? Why?"

**Your task**: Evaluate AI's pattern analysis.
- Does it identify filter pattern (`if` condition)?
- Does it identify transform pattern (expression changes value)?
- Does it explain that simple comprehensions are more readable?
- Can you articulate the rule: "1-line comprehension = good, complex = use loop"?

---

### Part 3: Student Teaches AI (When NOT to Use Comprehensions)

AI explained when comprehensions work. But does it know their LIMITS?

Challenge AI with unmaintainable code:

> "I wrote this 'clever' comprehension:
> ```python
> result = [[x*y for x in range(1, 6) if x % 2 == 0] for y in range(1, 4) if y != 2]
> ```
>
> Problems:
> 1. What does this even do? (Trace it)
> 2. Why is this TERRIBLE code for a team project?
> 3. Rewrite it using nested loops with clear variable names
> 4. Give me a RULE: When should I NEVER use a comprehension?
>
> Show me the refactored version and explain why it's better."

**Your task**: Understand readability limits.
- Does AI explain this is a nested comprehension (hard to read)?
- Does it show the loop version is clearer with comments?
- Does it give a rule like "If you can't explain it in one sentence, use a loop"?
- Can you now judge when a comprehension is too clever?

---

### Part 4: Build Data Pipeline Together (Convergence)

Now apply comprehensions to real data processing:

> "Build a grade processing pipeline:
> 1. Start with test scores: `[95, 67, 88, 72, 55, 91, 100, 45, 80]`
> 2. Filter: Keep only passing scores (>= 60)
> 3. Transform: Convert to letter grades (90-100='A', 80-89='B', 70-79='C', 60-69='D')
> 4. Count: How many of each grade?
>
> Requirements:
> - Use comprehension for filter step
> - Use loop for transform step (letter grades need multiple conditions)
> - Show type hints
> - Explain: Why comprehension for step 2 but loop for step 3?"

**Your task**: Review the hybrid approach.
- Does it use comprehension for simple filter (`score >= 60`)?
- Does it use loop for complex transform (if-elif-else for grades)?
- Does it explain that comprehensions work for SIMPLE expressions?
- Can you explain when to mix comprehensions and loops?

Iterate if needed:
> "Can the letter grade conversion be done with a comprehension using conditional expressions (ternary)? Show me, then tell me if it's more or less readable."

---

**Time**: 25-30 minutes total
**Outcome**: You've mastered list comprehension syntax, learned when they improve readability (simple filter/transform) vs. hurt it (nested/complex logic), and practiced hybrid approaches.

**Safety Note**: Comprehensions execute eagerly (build full list in memory). For large datasets (millions of items), use generator expressions `(x for x in items)` instead—you'll learn these in Chapter 20.

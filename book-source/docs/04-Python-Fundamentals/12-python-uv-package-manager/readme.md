# Chapter 12: The Lightning Python Stack — uv, Zed, Ruff & Pyright

Before you write Python programs, you need the right tools installed and working. Professional Python developers use modern toolchains that make development faster, catch errors early, and maintain code quality automatically.

This beginner-friendly chapter teaches you how to set up a **modern Python development environment** using professional tools: **uv** (package manager), **Zed** (AI-first IDE), **Ruff** (linter/formatter), and **Pyright** (type checker). This chapter focuses on **tool installation and basic usage**—not Python programming itself. You'll learn through simple AI-driven workflows where you specify what you want and AI helps with commands. Code examples are minimal (1-3 lines) and exist only to prove tools work.

Each tool is taught separately with clear step-by-step instructions. You'll learn what each tool does, how to install it, and how to use basic commands. AI assistance is available when you need it.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Explain** what uv, Zed, Ruff, and Pyright are and why each tool exists
- **Understand** why modern Python developers use these tools
- **Recognize** when to use direct commands vs. asking AI for help
- **Describe** what each tool does (package management, editing, formatting, type checking)
- **Install** uv, Zed, Ruff, and Pyright on your computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- **Open** and use Zed IDE for Python projects
- **Run** basic formatting and linting commands with Ruff
- **Check** Python code for type errors using Pyright
- **Create** simple configurations with AI assistance when needed

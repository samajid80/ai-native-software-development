# Game Character System (Capstone)

This capstone lesson integrates everything from Lessons 1-4 into a real system. You'll move from learning individual OOP concepts to designing and building a complete multi-class game system using the Four-Layer approach: (1) Specification discovery through AI, (2) Hands-on implementation with feedback, (3) Peer review with AI, (4) Extension and optimization.

---

## Part 1: Student Discovers Requirements Through AI Collaboration

**Your Role**: System architect working with AI to clarify requirements

### Collaborative Specification Exercise

**Stage 1: Ask AI to Describe the System**

Ask your AI companion:

> "I need to build a Game Character System for a turn-based RPG. I want:
> - A base Character class (Player and Enemy inherit from this)
> - Characters have: name, health, max_health, attack_power, defense
> - Characters can: attack(), take_damage(), heal()
> - Player can have an inventory (list of items)
> - Enemy has an AI strategy (random or aggressive)
>
> Before I code, help me think through the design:
> 1. What attributes should be protected/private vs public?
> 2. Should attack() be different for Player vs Enemy?
> 3. How would you structure the class hierarchy?
> 4. What data validation is critical?"

**Stage 2: Clarify Through Questions**

Based on AI's response, ask:

> "For my game design, I need to clarify:
> 1. Should healing restore HP instantly or trigger a cooldown?
> 2. Can attack_power change during battle?
> 3. What happens if health goes below 0? (instant death or states like 'knocked down'?)
> 4. Should Enemy class be able to do anything Player can't?"

**Your task 1**: Document AI's responses in `system_design_specification.md`:
- Base class design (what goes in Character vs subclasses?)
- Attribute access levels (public/protected/private)
- Method type selection (instance/class/static)
- Game logic rules

### Your Requirements Document

Create `game_system_requirements.md` with:

```markdown
# Game Character System Requirements

## Classes Needed

### Character (Base Class)
**Attributes**:
- name: str
- _health: float (protected)
- _max_health: float (protected)
- _attack_power: float (protected)
- _defense: float (protected)

**Methods**:
- attack(target: Character) -> float: Deal damage based on attack_power and target defense
- take_damage(amount: float): Reduce health, prevent going below 0
- heal(amount: float): Restore health, cap at max_health
- is_alive() -> bool: Check if health > 0

### Player(Character)
**Additional Attributes**:
- level: int
- experience: int
- inventory: list

**Additional Methods**:
- gain_experience(amount: int)
- use_item(item: str)
- level_up()

### Enemy(Character)
**Additional Attributes**:
- enemy_type: str
- ai_strategy: str ('random' or 'aggressive')

**Additional Methods**:
- choose_action() -> str: Decide attack or defend based on AI
```

**Deliverable**: Specification document that you'll use as the blueprint for implementation.

## Part 2: Student Implements the System Hands-On

**Your Role**: Developer building from specification

### Implementation Exercise

Using your specification, build the complete system:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Character(ABC):
    """Base class for all game characters"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, max_health: float, attack_power: float, defense: float):
        self.name = name
        self._max_health = max_health
        self._health = max_health
        self._attack_power = attack_power
        self._defense = defense

    def take_damage(self, amount: float) -> float:
        """Reduce health by damage minus defense"""
        actual_damage = max(0, amount - self._defense)
        self._health = max(0, self._health - actual_damage)
        return actual_damage

    def attack(self, target: 'Character') -> float:
        """Attack target and return damage dealt"""
        if not self.is_alive():
            return 0
        damage = max(0, self._attack_power + random.randint(-2, 2) - target._defense)
        target.take_damage(damage)
        return damage

    def heal(self, amount: float) -> float:
        """Restore health, return amount actually healed"""
        old_health = self._health
        self._health = min(self._max_health, self._health + amount)
        return self._health - old_health

    def is_alive(self) -> bool:
        """Check if character is alive"""
        return self._health > 0

    def get_health(self) -> float:
        """Safe accessor for health"""
        return self._health


class Player(Character):
    """Player-controlled character"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, max_health: float = 100, attack_power: float = 15, defense: float = 5):
        super().__init__(name, max_health, attack_power, defense)
        self.level = 1
        self.experience = 0
        self.inventory = []

    def gain_experience(self, amount: int):
        """Gain experience and level up if threshold reached"""
        self.experience += amount
        if self.experience >= 100:
            self.level_up()

    def level_up(self):
        """Increase stats and reset experience"""
        self.level += 1
        self._max_health += 20
        self._attack_power += 5
        self._defense += 2
        self._health = self._max_health
        self.experience = 0


class Enemy(Character):
    """AI-controlled enemy character"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, enemy_type: str, max_health: float = 50,
                 attack_power: float = 10, defense: float = 2, ai_strategy: str = "aggressive"):
        super().__init__(name, max_health, attack_power, defense)
        self.enemy_type = enemy_type
        self.ai_strategy = ai_strategy

    def choose_action(self, player: Player) -> str:
        """Decide action based on AI strategy"""
        if not self.is_alive():
            return "dead"

        if self.ai_strategy == "aggressive":
            return "attack"
        elif self.ai_strategy == "cautious":
            if self._health < self._max_health * 0.3:
                return "defend"
            return "attack"
        else:  # random
            return "attack" if random.random() > 0.5 else "defend"
```

**Your task 2**: Write and test the implementation:
- Create Player and Enemy objects
- Simulate a battle (3-5 turns)
- Test edge cases (healing overcap, damage to dead characters)
- Document what works and what needs refinement

### Your Implementation

Create `game_character_system.py` with:
- Complete Character, Player, Enemy classes
- Test code demonstrating a battle
- Comments explaining your design decisions

**Deliverable**: Fully functional game system matching your specification.

---

## Part 3: AI Reviews Your Implementation

**Your Role**: Developer receiving code review from AI

### Code Review Exercise

Paste your code and ask:

> "Review my Game Character System for design quality. Check:
> 1. Are my access levels (public/protected/private) appropriate?
> 2. Did I use inheritance effectively or is there duplication?
> 3. Are my method types (instance/class/static) correct?
> 4. What edge cases did I miss?
> 5. What would a professional production system add that I'm missing?"

### Convergence Activity

Based on AI's feedback, ask:

> "For the three things I should fix immediately, show me the refactored code and explain why each change improves the design."

**Deliverable**: List of improvements and refactored code sections addressing AI's feedback.

---

## Part 4: Student Extends the System

**Your Role**: Designer adding features based on deeper understanding

### Extension Exercise

Choose one extension and implement it:

**Option A: Combat System**
```python
# Add turn-based combat simulation
class Battle:
    def __init__(self, player: Player, enemy: Enemy):
        self.player = player
        self.enemy = enemy
        self.turn = 0

    def simulate_turn(self):
        """Execute one combat round"""
        # Player acts
        # Enemy decides action
        # Apply effects
        # Check end conditions
        pass

    def run_battle(self) -> str:
        """Simulate until one character dies, return winner"""
        pass
```

**Option B: Item System**
```python
class Item:
    def __init__(self, name: str, item_type: str, value: float):
        self.name = name
        self.item_type = item_type
        self.value = value

    def use(self, character: Character):
        """Apply item effects"""
        pass
```

**Option C: Experience and Progression**
- Implement experience scaling
- Add equipment (weapons, armor)
- Create skill system

**Your task**: Implement one extension that requires new classes or significant refactoring.

**Deliverable**: Extended system with 1-2 new features, tested and documented.

---

## Part 5: AI Validation and Professional Polish

**Your Role**: Engineer ensuring production quality

### Final Validation Exercise

Ask AI:

> "Final review: Does my Game Character System demonstrate:
> 1. Proper use of OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction)?
> 2. Professional Python style (type hints, docstrings, naming)?
> 3. Robust error handling and edge cases?
> 4. Clear code organization?
> 5. Appropriate access control and method design?
>
> Give me a final checklist of what would make this production-ready."

### Your Final Deliverables

1. **game_system_requirements.md** - Full specification
2. **game_character_system.py** - Complete implementation
3. **ai_review_feedback.md** - AI's code review and your responses
4. **extended_system.py** - One implemented extension
5. **professional_checklist.md** - Production-readiness criteria and how you meet them

## Try With AI

Ready to build a complete multi-class system that demonstrates OOP mastery?

**🔍 Explore System Design:**
> "I want to build a game character system with Warriors, Mages, and Archers. Each has health, name, and class-specific abilities (warrior: melee_attack, mage: cast_spell, archer: shoot_arrow). Help me design: should they share a base Character class? What attributes are common vs specific? How should abilities differ?"

**🎯 Practice Class Hierarchy:**
> "Guide me through building the character system step-by-step. Start with base Character class (__init__ with name, health, level). Then create Warrior subclass adding strength attribute and attack() method. Show me how Warrior inherits from Character and extends it. What goes in base vs subclass?"

**🧪 Test Encapsulation and Validation:**
> "Add validation to the character system: health can't go below 0 or above max_health (100), level starts at 1, name can't be empty. Use properties or validation in __init__. Then create a take_damage(amount) method. Show me how validation prevents invalid states (negative health, empty name)."

**🚀 Apply Complete System:**
> "Build a complete battle system: create 3 characters (Warrior, Mage, Archer), implement attacks that reduce target health, add is_alive() method, create fight_round(attacker, defender) function. Demonstrate full combat until one character's health reaches 0. Show all OOP principles: encapsulation, methods, independent object state."

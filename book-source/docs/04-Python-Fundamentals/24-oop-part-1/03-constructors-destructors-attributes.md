# Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes

Now that you can create basic classes, you'll dive deeper into sophisticated patterns: constructors with flexible parameters, the critical distinction between class and instance attributes, and object cleanup with destructors.

In this lesson, you'll discover why these patterns matter through hands-on experiments, learn from AI explanations, challenge the AI with subtle edge cases, and build a comprehensive reference guide.

---

## Part 1: Experience Default Parameters and Attribute Types

**Your Role**: Code experimenter discovering initialization patterns and attribute scoping

### Discovery Exercise 1: Why Default Parameters Matter

Create `attribute_experiments.py` and run this:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.age = age

# Works fine, but requires ALL parameters
dog1 = Dog("Max", "Labrador", 5)

# What if you don't know the age? Forced to use placeholder
dog2 = Dog("Unknown", "Mixed", 0)  # Awkward!
```

Now add a default parameter:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str, age: int = 0):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.age = age

# Now flexible!
dog1 = Dog("Max", "Labrador", 5)
dog2 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden")  # Uses default age=0
```

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I added a default parameter age=0 to my Dog class. Now I can create dogs with or without age. But when should parameters be required vs have defaults? Show me 3 examples: 1) user registration (which fields must be required?), 2) database connection (which have sensible defaults?), 3) API client config. Explain the design principle."

**Expected Understanding**: AI will explain that **critical data should be required** (no default), **convenience data can have defaults**. You'll see the tradeoff between flexibility and enforced completeness.

---

### Discovery Exercise 2: Instance vs Class Attributes

Run this experiment:

```python
class Dog:
    species: str = "Canis familiaris"  # Class attribute - ALL dogs share this

    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str):
        self.name = name      # Instance attribute - each dog's own
        self.breed = breed    # Instance attribute - each dog's own

dog1 = Dog("Max", "Labrador")
dog2 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden")

# Change class attribute
Dog.species = "Canis lupus familiaris"
print(dog1.species)  # Changed!
print(dog2.species)  # Changed! (both see the update)

# Change instance attribute
dog1.name = "Max Jr."
print(dog2.name)  # Still "Buddy" (independent)
```

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I have Dog class with species (class attribute) and name (instance attribute). When Dog.species changes, ALL dogs see it. When dog1.name changes, only dog1 is affected. Explain:
> 1. What's stored in memory differently for class vs instance attributes?
> 2. Give me 3 real-world examples where class attributes make sense (like API base_url, database connection pool, configuration)
> 3. When should I avoid class attributes?"

**Expected Understanding**: AI will explain that class attributes are shared memory (one copy), instance attributes are per-object memory (N copies). Use class attributes for configuration, constants, shared state. Avoid for mutable data that should be independent.

---

### Discovery Exercise 3: The Shadowing Trap

Run this and observe strange behavior:

```python
class Counter:
    count: int = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

c1 = Counter("First")
c2 = Counter("Second")

print(c1.count)  # 0 (reading class attribute)
print(c2.count)  # 0 (reading class attribute)

# Now the trap:
c1.count = 5  # Creates INSTANCE attribute (shadowing the class attribute!)

print(c1.count)       # 5 (instance attribute)
print(c2.count)       # 0 (still class attribute)
print(Counter.count)  # 0 (class attribute unchanged)
```

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I tried to update a class attribute through an instance (c1.count = 5) but it created an INSTANCE attribute instead, shadowing the class attribute. Now c1.count and c2.count are different!
> 1. Why does Python allow this? Is it a bug or feature?
> 2. How do I update class attributes correctly? (Hint: use ClassName.attribute)
> 3. Show me how to detect if an attribute is instance or class using __dict__"

**Expected Understanding**: AI will explain that `obj.attr = value` ALWAYS creates instance attribute. To modify class attributes, use `ClassName.attr = value`. Shadowing is intentional but often confusing. Use `hasattr()` and `__dict__` for inspection.

### Your Discovery Summary

Instead of manual files, **use AI to synthesize**:

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "Based on my experiments with default parameters, instance/class attributes, and shadowing, summarize these key insights:
> 1. When should constructor parameters be required vs have defaults?
> 2. When should data be instance attributes vs class attributes?
> 3. What's the shadowing trap and how do I avoid it?
>
> Give me 3 bullet points for my reference guide."

**Deliverable**: Save AI's synthesis in your notes. You've discovered constructor design patterns—now you're ready to learn advanced techniques.

## Part 2: Learn Advanced Constructor Patterns

**Your Role**: Student receiving instruction from AI Teacher

### AI Teaching Prompt

Ask your AI companion:

> "I'm designing classes with optional parameters and I've discovered two types of attributes:
> - Instance attributes like `self.name` (each object has its own)
> - Class attributes like `tricks_known = 0` (shared across all objects)
>
> Explain:
> 1. When should I use default parameters in `__init__`?
> 2. What's the memory layout difference between instance and class attributes?
> 3. If dog1.tricks_known = 5 creates a new instance attribute, what happens to the class attribute?
> 4. Show me a real example where class attributes are useful (not artificial)."

### What You'll Learn from AI

**Expected AI Response** (summary):

- **Default parameters**: Make constructors flexible for optional data
- **Instance attributes**: Each object has independent copies
- **Class attributes**: All objects share one copy
- **Shadowing**: Creating instance attribute hides class attribute temporarily
- **Real use case**: Configuration values (class) vs instance data (instance)

### Convergence Activity

After AI explains, ask:

> "Walk me through what happens in memory when I create `dog = Dog('Max')` in a class that has both `species = 'Dog'` (class attribute) and `self.name = name` (instance attribute)."

**Deliverable**: Write a summary explaining when to use default parameters, class vs instance attributes, and why shadowing is important.

---

## Part 3: Challenge AI with Edge Cases

**Your Role**: Student teaching AI by testing edge case understanding

#### Challenge 1: Default Parameters and Mutability

**Your prompt to AI**:

> "I see a lot of code that uses `def __init__(self, items: list = []):`. But online I see warnings that this is dangerous. Why is using a mutable default parameter (list, dict) problematic? Show me an example where this goes wrong and explain what's happening."

**Expected learning**: AI will explain that mutable defaults are shared across all instances, causing hidden bugs.

#### Challenge 2: Class Attributes in AI Agents

**Your prompt to AI**:

> "I'm designing a ChatAgent class. Configuration like `model_name = 'gpt-4'` could be:
> - A class attribute (all agents use same model)
> - An instance attribute in __init__ (each agent can use different model)
>
> For these scenarios, which should it be:
> 1. All agents in production use gpt-4, test agents use gpt-3.5
> 2. Each conversation with a user uses a potentially different model
> 3. The API key for authentication
>
> Explain your reasoning."

**Expected learning**: AI will explain design decisions about when to share data.

#### Challenge 3: Attribute Inheritance Behavior

**Your prompt to AI**:

> "If I create a subclass of Dog:
> ```python
> class Dog:
>     species = 'Canis familiaris'
>
> class Husky(Dog):
>     pass
>
> h = Husky()
> h.species = 'Husky Mix'
> ```
>
> Does this create an instance attribute on h that shadows Dog.species? Or does it modify the class attribute? Show me how to verify which happened."

### Deliverable

Document your three challenges and AI's responses with your analysis of correctness.

## Part 4: Build Your Attributes and Constructors Reference

**Your Role**: Knowledge synthesizer creating design patterns

Create `constructor_and_attributes_guide.md`:

```markdown
# Constructors with Defaults and Attributes Guide

## Pattern 1: Basic Constructor with Defaults

**When to use**: Optional parameters that don't need validation

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int = 0, city: str = "Unknown"):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.city = city

# All these work
Person("Alice", 30, "NYC")      # All parameters
Person("Bob", 25)                # Uses default city
Person("Charlie")                # Uses default age and city
```

**Key principle**: Required parameters first, optional last

---

## Pattern 2: Default Parameters with Validation

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, holder: str, initial_balance: float = 0.0):
        if initial_balance < 0:
            raise ValueError("Balance cannot be negative")
        self.holder = holder
        self.balance = initial_balance
```

**Key principle**: Validate before storing

---

## Pattern 3: Distinguishing Instance vs Class Attributes

**Instance attributes** (use in `__init__`):
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str):
        self.name = name        # Each dog has its own name
        self.breed = breed      # Each dog has its own breed
```

**Class attributes** (define in class body):
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # All dogs are this species
    total_dogs = 0                # Track total dogs created

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
```

**Rule**: If data is specific to one object → instance attribute. If data is shared → class attribute.

---

## Pattern 4: Updating Class Attributes

```python
class Game:
    high_score = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, player_name: str):
        self.player_name = player_name  # Instance
        self.score = 0                  # Instance

g1 = Game("Alice")
g1.score = 100

# To update class attribute, use ClassName.attribute
Game.high_score = 100  # All Game objects see this

# NOT through instance (creates shadowing):
# g1.high_score = 100  # This creates instance attribute, doesn't modify class attribute
```

---

## Pattern 5: Detecting Attribute Type

```python
obj = Dog("Max")
obj.name = "Max Jr."

# Is name instance or class attribute?
print("name" in obj.__dict__)  # True = instance, False = class

print(Dog.__dict__["species"])  # Access class attribute via class
```

---

## Pattern 6: Avoiding Mutable Default Parameters

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Mutable default shared between instances!
class Classroom:
    def __init__(self, name: str, students: list = []):
        self.name = name
        self.students = students

class1 = Classroom("A")
class2 = Classroom("B")
class1.students.append("Alice")
print(class2.students)  # ["Alice"] - SHARED!

# ✅ CORRECT - Use None, create new list inside
class Classroom:
    def __init__(self, name: str, students: list = None):
        self.name = name
        self.students = students if students is not None else []
```

---

## Pattern 7: Class Attributes for Configuration

```python
class APIClient:
    # Configuration shared by all clients
    base_url = "https://api.example.com"
    timeout = 30

    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        # Each client has unique credentials
        self.api_key = api_key

# All clients use same base URL and timeout
# But each has different API key
```

---

## Constructor Pattern Checklist

When designing a constructor, ask:

1. **What parameters are required?** (must provide)
2. **What parameters are optional?** (have sensible defaults)
3. **Should this be a class attribute?** (shared across instances)
4. **Should this be an instance attribute?** (specific to each object)
5. **Do I need validation?** (check constraints)

### Validation with AI

> "Review my constructor and attribute design patterns. Are my recommendations about when to use defaults vs required parameters sound? What patterns am I missing?"

**Deliverable**: Complete guide with all patterns and checklist.

## Try With AI

Ready to master constructors with defaults, understand attribute scoping, and avoid mutable default traps?

**🔍 Explore Default Parameters:**
> "Show me a User class with required name parameter and optional email, role (default='user'), created_at (default=now). Create users with: all params, only name, name+email. Explain when defaults help vs when they hide required data. What's the tradeoff?"

**🎯 Practice Instance vs Class Attributes:**
> "Build a BankAccount class where: interest_rate is shared by all accounts (class attribute), but balance is per-account (instance attribute). Create accounts, change interest_rate on the class, show how all accounts see the new rate. When should attributes be shared vs independent?"

**🧪 Test Mutable Default Danger:**
> "Create a Team class with members parameter defaulting to []. Add members to team1. Create team2 without members. What's in team2.members? Why? Show me the fix (members=None, then self.members = members or []). Explain the Python default parameter gotcha."

**🚀 Apply to Configuration:**
> "I'm building a database connection class. It needs: required host/database, optional port (default 5432), user (default 'admin'), connection_pool settings (dict). Design the __init__ with appropriate defaults. Which params must be provided vs can have sensible defaults?"

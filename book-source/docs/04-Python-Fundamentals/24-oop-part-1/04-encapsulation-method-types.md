# Encapsulation and Method Types

Now you'll master professional-grade class design through access control and multiple method types. In this lesson, you'll discover why encapsulation matters through experimentation, learn from AI how to protect attributes and design methods, challenge AI with real-world design decisions, and build a comprehensive guide for method selection.

## Part 1: Student Discovers Access Control and Method Types

**Your Role**: Code explorer discovering why data protection and method organization matter

### Discovery Exercise: The Unprotected Account Problem

Create `method_discovery.py`:

```python
# Without encapsulation - dangerous!
class UnsafeBankAccount:
    def __init__(self, holder: str, balance: float):
        self.balance = balance
        self.holder = holder

account = UnsafeBankAccount("Alice", 1000)

# Oops! Bug in my code sets balance to impossible value
account.balance = -999999  # No validation!
print(account.balance)  # -999999

# What if multiple methods need to work with balance?
# If format changes, I have to update everywhere
```

**Your task 1**: Identify the problems:
- What prevents setting invalid balances?
- If I have 100 methods using `self.balance`, and I need to add a fee calculation, where do I modify code?

### Discovering the Solution: Method Types

**Stage 2: Using Instance Methods**

```python
class SaferBankAccount:
    def __init__(self, holder: str, balance: float):
        self._balance = balance  # Protected
        self.holder = holder

    def deposit(self, amount: float) -> float:
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit must be positive")
        self._balance += amount
        return self._balance

    def get_balance(self) -> float:
        return self._balance

account = SaferBankAccount("Alice", 1000)
account.deposit(100)  # Uses method, validated
# account._balance = -999  # Possible, but naming says "don't do this"
```

**Your task 2**: Run this and observe:
- How does using methods instead of direct attribute access help?
- What happens if someone ignores the _ convention?

**Stage 3: Discovering Private Attributes**

```python
class SecureBankAccount:
    def __init__(self, holder: str, balance: float):
        self.__balance = balance  # Double underscore - name mangled
        self.holder = holder

    def deposit(self, amount: float) -> float:
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit must be positive")
        self.__balance += amount
        return self.__balance

    def get_balance(self) -> float:
        return self.__balance

account = SecureBankAccount("Alice", 1000)
print(account.get_balance())  # 1000
# Try: account.__balance  # AttributeError!
# Try: account._SecureBankAccount__balance  # Works, but ugly - don't do it
```

**Your task 3**: Run this and answer:
- Can you access __balance directly?
- Is this truly "private" or just annoying?

### Discovery Exercise 2: Multiple Method Types

**Stage 4: Instance Methods vs Class Methods vs Static Methods**

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    total_dogs_created = 0

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        Dog.total_dogs_created += 1

    # Instance method - operates on self
    def bark(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.name} says: Woof!"

    # Class method - operates on class, not instance
    @classmethod
    def from_breed_name(cls, name: str, breed: str):
        """Factory method to create dogs with breed"""
        return cls(f"{name} ({breed})")

    # Static method - doesn't need self or cls
    @staticmethod
    def is_good_name(name: str) -> bool:
        return len(name) >= 2

# Instance method needs object
dog = Dog("Max")
print(dog.bark())  # Works - operates on Max

# Class method uses class, can be used without instance
dog2 = Dog.from_breed_name("Buddy", "Labrador")

# Static method is just a function in class namespace
print(Dog.is_good_name("M"))  # False
```

**Your task 4**: Run this and observe:
- Which methods need an object to work?
- Which can work with just the class?
- Which are just utility functions grouped with the class?

### Your Discoveries

Document in `method_type_analysis.md`:
1. Why do instance methods use `self`?
2. When would you use a class method instead?
3. When would a static method be useful?
4. Why protect attributes with methods instead of direct access?

## Part 2: AI Explains Access Control and Method Design

**Your Role**: Student receiving instruction from AI Teacher

### AI Teaching Prompt

Ask your AI companion:

> "I've discovered three method types and different access control levels. Show me and explain:
> 1. What's the difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod?
> 2. When should I use each?
> 3. For a BankAccount class, which method type would you use for:
>    - deposit() which changes THIS account's balance
>    - get_interest_rate() which all accounts share
>    - is_valid_account_number() which just validates a string
> 4. Show me how to enforce that balance can't be negative using a property."

### Convergence Activity

After AI explains, ask: "Show me how the @property decorator works for protecting an attribute while allowing read access. Why is this better than a get_balance() method?"

**Deliverable**: Write summary explaining when to use each method type.

---

## Part 3: Student Challenges AI with Method Design

**Your Role**: Student teaching AI by testing design understanding

#### Challenge 1: Factory Pattern

> "Show me a Dog class where you have a class method that creates a Dog from a string like 'Max_Labrador_5'. Why is this better than having users call __init__ directly?"

#### Challenge 2: Properties vs Methods

> "In a class with a `_balance` attribute, would you expose it as:
> - A method: account.get_balance()
> - A property: account.balance (looks like attribute but uses @property)
>
> Which feels more Pythonic? Why?"

#### Challenge 3: Static Methods in Practice

> "When would a static method be useful? Show me a real example where a static method makes sense vs a module-level function."

### Deliverable

Document challenges and AI responses with your analysis.

## Part 4: Build Your Method Design Guide

**Your Role**: Knowledge synthesizer creating design framework

Create `method_types_and_encapsulation_guide.md`:

```markdown
# Method Types and Encapsulation Guide

## Instance Methods
Use when: Method operates on specific object's data

```python
def deposit(self, amount: float):
    self._balance += amount
```

## Class Methods (@classmethod)
Use when: Method operates on class data or creates instances

```python
@classmethod
def from_dict(cls, data: dict):
    return cls(data['name'], data['balance'])
```

## Static Methods (@staticmethod)
Use when: Utility function grouped with class but doesn't need instance or class

```python
@staticmethod
def is_valid_account_number(num: str) -> bool:
    return len(num) == 10
```

## Access Levels

- **Public**: `self.name` - Direct access encouraged
- **Protected**: `self._balance` - Convention, don't access directly
- **Private**: `self.__ssn` - Name mangled, discourage access

## Properties (@property/@setter)
Make attributes look like data while using method validation

```python
@property
def balance(self) -> float:
    return self._balance

@balance.setter
def balance(self, value: float):
    if value < 0:
        raise ValueError("Balance cannot be negative")
    self._balance = value
```
```

**Deliverable**: Complete guide with method type selection criteria.

## Try With AI

Ready to understand encapsulation, master method types, and control attribute access with properties?

**🔍 Explore Public vs Protected vs Private:**
> "Build a BankAccount class with three attributes: account_number (public), _balance (protected, convention), __pin (private, name-mangled). Show me how to access each from outside the class. Explain why balance should be protected and what Python's name mangling does with __pin."

**🎯 Practice Instance vs Class vs Static Methods:**
> "Create a MathHelper class. Add three methods: 1) instance method square_value(self, x) using instance state, 2) class method create_with_preset(cls, preset_name) returning new object, 3) static method is_prime(n) with no self or cls. Explain when to use each type."

**🧪 Test Properties for Validation:**
> "Build a Person class with age property. Use @property for getter, @age.setter for setter that validates (0 <= age <= 150). Try: person.age = -5, person.age = 200, person.age = 25. Show how properties enable validation without breaking the attribute access API. Why is this better than get_age()/set_age()?"

**🚀 Apply to Data Validation:**
> "I'm building a Product class. Price must be positive, stock can't be negative, discount must be 0-100%. Design the class with properties that validate on every set. Show validation error messages. How do properties make the API cleaner than validate_and_set_price() methods?"

# Chapter 17: Control Flow and Loops

Programs don't just execute code in a straight line. They make decisions, repeat actions, and jump based on conditions. In this chapter, you'll learn how programs **control their flow**—how they choose between different paths and repeat code efficiently.

Control flow is the foundation of every program. Your email app decides whether to mark messages as spam. Your game decides when the player wins. Your banking app decides whether to approve a transaction. All of these require **conditionals** (making decisions) and **loops** (repeating actions).

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to write programs that make decisions and automate repetitive tasks—the two core skills of programming.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll master:

### Conditionals (Making Decisions)

- **Lesson 1: Understanding Decisions** — Recognize when programs need to make choices and how Boolean values (True/False) control behavior
- **Lesson 2: If and Else** — Write binary decisions (if this happens, do this; otherwise, do that)
- **Lesson 3: Multiple Choices with Elif** — Handle multiple possibilities with elif chains
- **Lesson 4: Nesting Conditions** — Combine conditions to test multiple requirements simultaneously

### Loops (Repeating Actions)

- **Lesson 5: For Loops Basics** — Repeat code a known number of times using for loops and range()
- **Lesson 6: While Loops** — Repeat code until a condition changes (and avoid infinite loops)
- **Lesson 7: Controlling Loops** — Exit loops early with break or skip iterations with continue

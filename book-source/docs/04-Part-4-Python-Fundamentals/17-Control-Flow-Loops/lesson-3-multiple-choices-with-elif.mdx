# Lesson 3: Multiple Choices with Elif

## Opening Hook

Grading depends on score: IF score >= 90, grade is A. ELIF score >= 80, grade is B. ELIF score >= 70, grade is C. ELSE, grade is F. What if you wrote this as multiple if statements instead? All of them would test, even after you found a match. The **elif** statement solves this—it tests conditions IN ORDER until one is true, then stops. This lesson teaches elif chains for multiple choices.

## Elif Syntax: Testing Multiple Conditions in Sequence

**elif** stands for "else-if". It lets you test another condition if the previous one was false.

**Pattern:**

```python
if condition1:
    # runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # runs if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
else:
    # runs if ALL conditions are False
```

**Critical rule:** Conditions are tested in order, top to bottom. The FIRST condition that is true runs, and all others are skipped.

**Worked example: Temperature categories**

```python
temp: int = 18
if temp < 0:
    print("Freezing")
elif temp < 15:
    print("Cold")
elif temp < 25:
    print("Mild")
else:
    print("Hot")

# Trace: temp=18
# Is 18 < 0? No → skip if block
# Is 18 < 15? No → skip elif block
# Is 18 < 25? Yes → prints "Mild", stop checking
```

---

## Order Matters: Why Condition Sequence Is Critical

The ORDER of elif conditions is critical. Test broader conditions LAST; test specific conditions FIRST.

**BAD ORDER (Wrong logic):**

```python
score: int = 95
if score >= 70:
    print("Pass")  # This runs for ANY score >= 70
elif score >= 90:
    print("Excellent")  # This NEVER runs for 95 (already passed the first condition)
```

**CORRECT ORDER (Right logic):**

```python
score: int = 95
if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent")  # Test most specific first (90+)
elif score >= 80:
    print("Good")  # Then less specific (80-89)
elif score >= 70:
    print("Pass")  # Then least specific (70-79)
else:
    print("Fail")  # Finally, the fallback
```

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Why is the ORDER of elif conditions important? What happens if we test the wrong condition first?"

This builds your understanding of condition evaluation.

## Reading and Tracing Elif Chains

To predict elif output, trace it:
1. Test first condition
2. If true, run that block and STOP
3. If false, test next condition
4. Repeat until one is true or reach else
5. Only ONE block ever runs

**Worked example: Trace with different inputs**

```python
age: int = 25
if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 18:
    print("Teen")
elif age < 65:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")
```

**Trace with age = 25:**
- Is 25 < 13? No
- Is 25 < 18? No
- Is 25 < 65? Yes → prints "Adult", stop

**Trace with age = 10:**
- Is 10 < 13? Yes → prints "Child", stop

**Trace with age = 70:**
- Is 70 < 13? No
- Is 70 < 18? No
- Is 70 < 65? No → prints "Senior" (else block)

## Common Mistakes in Elif Chains

**Mistake 1: Using `=` instead of `==`**

```python
# WRONG - = is assignment, not comparison
if age = 18:  # SyntaxError
    print("Adult")

# CORRECT - == is comparison
if age == 18:  # Checks if age equals 18
    print("Adult")
```

**Mistake 2: Forgetting indentation**

```python
# WRONG
if age >= 18:
print("Adult")  # IndentationError

# CORRECT
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
```

**Mistake 3: Assuming multiple if statements act like elif**

```python
# WRONG THINKING - both blocks might run
score: int = 95
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
if score >= 80:  # This ALSO runs because it's a separate if
    print("B")
# Prints: A, B (both run!)

# CORRECT - elif stops after first match
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:  # This doesn't test if first was true
    print("B")
# Prints: A (only one runs)
```

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, you design the decision logic (what conditions, what order?). Your AI partner handles the exact elif syntax. Your job: think clearly about "does this condition make sense here?" and "will multiple paths run or just one?"

## Code Examples

### Example 3A: Temperature Grading with Elif

```python
def categorize_temperature(temp: float) -> str:
    if temp < 0:
        return "Freezing"
    elif temp < 15:
        return "Cold"
    elif temp < 25:
        return "Mild"
    else:
        return "Hot"

# Test different temperatures
print(categorize_temperature(-5))   # "Freezing"
print(categorize_temperature(10))   # "Cold"
print(categorize_temperature(20))   # "Mild"
print(categorize_temperature(30))   # "Hot"
```

### Example 3B: Grading System with Elif

```python
score: int = 85
if score >= 90:
    grade: str = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")  # "Score: 85, Grade: B"
```

### Example 3C: User Permission Levels with Elif

```python
role: str = "admin"
if role == "admin":
    print("Can delete users, modify settings")
elif role == "moderator":
    print("Can delete posts, ban users")
elif role == "user":
    print("Can view, post, comment")
else:
    print("Unknown role")

# Output: "Can delete users, modify settings"
```

## Practice Approach

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Create an elif chain that categorizes a person by age: baby (0-2), child (3-12), teen (13-19), adult (20-64), senior (65+). Include type hints. Why did you order the conditions that way?"

Expected outcome: You understand condition ordering and can write elif chains for real classifications.

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use Claude Code to debug order mistakes: "I wrote an elif but it's not working right—the wrong branch runs. Help me fix the condition order."

## Try With AI

**Tool**: ChatGPT

**Prompts**:

1. **Recall**: "What does elif do? Why not just use multiple if statements?"

2. **Apply**: "Write an elif chain that categorizes test scores: A (90+), B (80-89), C (70-79), F (\<70). Include type hints."

3. **Analyze**: "Trace this elif chain and predict output for score=85, then score=95: `if score >= 90: print('A') elif score >= 80: print('B') elif score >= 70: print('C') else: print('F')`"

4. **Synthesize**: "Create an elif chain for a real classification problem (weather categories, membership levels, shipping costs, etc.). Explain the condition order."

**Expected Outcomes**:
- You can write elif chains with correct syntax
- You understand that condition order matters
- You can predict elif behavior by tracing code
- You know when elif is better than multiple if statements

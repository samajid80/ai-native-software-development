# Testing AI Safely with Branches

## Parallel Testing for AI Experiments

Imagine Claude Code suggests two different approaches to solve a problem. Which is better? Without branches, you'd implement one, delete it, then try the other. **Branches let you test both simultaneously.**

Think of a branch as a parallel universe. You can:
- Create multiple branches for different AI solutions
- Test each one safely (main code stays untouched)
- Compare results
- Merge the winner, delete the rest

This lesson shows you how to use branches for **safe parallel testing** with AI-generated code.

---

## Five Core Concepts at a Glance

This lesson covers exactly 5 concepts (within A1 cognitive limits):

1. **Branches** — isolated development timelines (independent versions of your code)
2. **Branch creation** — using `git branch` or `git checkout -b` to start a new experiment
3. **Branch switching** — using `git switch` or `git checkout` to move between branches
4. **Merging** — integrating changes from one branch back into another
5. **Branch deletion** — cleaning up completed experiments with `git branch -d`

By the end of this lesson, you'll have hands-on experience creating branches, watching code changes stay isolated, testing them safely, and merging winners back to main.

---

## Part 1: Hands-On Discovery—What Are Branches?

Let's start by observing branches in action. You have a committed project on your `main` branch. Now you'll create a parallel branch without touching main.

### Activity 1: Create Your First Branch

Open your terminal in your Git repository (the one from Lessons 1-2).

**Execute this command:**

```bash
git branch feature-simple
```

**What just happened?** Git created a new branch pointer named `feature-simple` pointing to your current commit. Your code hasn't changed—you're still on `main`.

**Observe it:**

```bash
git branch
```

**Expected output:**
```
  feature-simple
* main
```

The asterisk (*) shows you're currently on `main`. The branch `feature-simple` exists but is waiting for you to switch to it.

**Discovery question**: "What if I switch to this new branch? Will my main code be protected?"

---

### Activity 2: Switch to the Branch (Two Equivalent Approaches)

You can use either `git switch` (modern) or `git checkout` (traditional). Both work identically.

**Modern approach (Git 2.23+):**

```bash
git switch feature-simple
```

**Traditional approach (still works):**

```bash
git checkout feature-simple
```

**Either command switches you to the branch.** Let's verify:

```bash
git status
```

**Expected output:**
```
On branch feature-simple
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Key observation**: You're now "on" `feature-simple`, not `main`. But look at your files—nothing changed because the branch points to the same commit as main (for now).

---

### Activity 3: Create Changes on Your Branch (Isolation in Action)

Now you'll make a change **only on this branch**. Let's create a new file called `approach-simple.txt`:

**Create the file with this content:**

```bash
cat > approach-simple.txt << 'EOF'
Solution Approach: Simple
========================

Strategy: Keep it minimal
- Use basic text format
- Easy to understand
- Quick to implement
EOF
```

**What this command does:**
- `cat > approach-simple.txt << 'EOF'` = create file with multiple lines (from Lesson 2)
- Everything between the first `EOF` and last `EOF` becomes the file content
- Result: creates `approach-simple.txt` with the solution approach text inside

**Add and commit on your branch:**

```bash
git add approach-simple.txt
git commit -m "feat: add simple approach"
```

**Now switch back to main:**

```bash
git switch main
```

**Look at your files. What do you see?**

```bash
ls
```

**Expected output:** `approach-simple.txt` disappears! It only exists on the `feature-simple` branch.

**This is branch isolation in action.** Your main branch is completely untouched. If this feature is terrible, you can simply delete the `feature-simple` branch and never merge it. Main code stays safe.

---

## Part 2: Three Roles Demonstration—AI, You, and Convergence

Now we move from observation to collaboration. This is where AI becomes a learning partner, not just an executor.

### Scenario 1: AI as Teacher—Learning Branch Best Practices

**What you ask AI:**

Prompt your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude Code, etc.) with:

```
I'm using Git branches to test multiple approaches to a feature.
What are best practices for branch naming and organization?
```

**What AI teaches you:**

AI might respond with conventions you didn't explicitly ask for:

```
Common branch naming conventions:
- feature/auth-login (for features)
- bugfix/password-reset (for bug fixes)
- refactor/database-schema (for refactoring)
- experiment/caching-strategy (for exploratory work)

Benefits of naming conventions:
- Team members instantly understand branch purpose
- Automated tools can process branch names (e.g., auto-delete experiments)
- GitHub shows branch type in the interface
```

**What you learned:** AI taught you a **naming convention system** you didn't explicitly ask for. You now understand that good naming communicates intent to your future self and teammates.

**Key moment:** This is AI as Teacher—suggesting a pattern (naming conventions) that improves your workflow.

---

### Scenario 2: Student as Teacher—Teaching AI Your Constraints

Now you reverse roles. You had a previous experience the AI doesn't know about.

**What you tell AI:**

```
In my previous project, I created too many experimental branches
and they cluttered the repository. For this project, I want to
delete branches immediately after testing them.
Can you remind me which Git command deletes a branch?
```

**What AI suggests:**

```
To delete a merged branch:
git branch -d feature-simple

To force-delete an unmerged branch:
git branch -D feature-simple
```

**But you correct AI:**

```
Good—but I should only force-delete if I'm certain.
I'll use -d and fix merge conflicts if they exist.
Let me be more disciplined about cleaning up.
```

**What AI learns:** AI adapted to **your constraint** (branch clutter caused previous problems). AI now knows to suggest safe deletion (`-d`) as your preference.

**Key moment:** This is Student as Teacher—you corrected AI and taught it about your project context and constraints.

---

### Scenario 3: AI as Co-Worker—Convergence Through Iteration

Here's where both of you iterate together, and the final solution is better than either would create alone.

**Iteration 1: Initial branch strategy**

You ask AI: "I want to test two ways to optimize this feature. One is simple but slower. One is complex but faster. How should I organize this in Git?"

**AI suggests:** "Create two branches: `feature/simple-optimization` and `feature/fast-optimization`. Test both. Merge the winner."

You think: "That works, but how do I remember which is faster after testing?"

**Iteration 2: You add a constraint**

You ask AI: "When I merge the winning branch, how can I document performance metrics in the Git history?"

**AI suggests:** "Add a performance note to your commit message before merging."

You think: "Good idea, but I want the metrics visible in the PR description too."

**Iteration 3: Convergence**

Together you arrive at:
1. Create two branches for parallel testing
2. Make notes during testing (performance times, trade-offs)
3. Document findings in commit message: `feat: optimize query (5x faster, uses 2x memory)`
4. Create PR with detailed performance comparison in description
5. Merge winning branch with full context preserved

**What neither of you had individually:**
- You didn't think of documenting performance in the commit message initially
- AI didn't know this was important without your feedback
- Together, you created a reusable pattern: **Document performance metrics in both commit and PR**

**Key moment:** This is Co-Worker convergence—iteration improved both of your understanding. Future projects will use this pattern.

---

## Part 3: Hands-On Workflow—Creating and Merging Branches

Let's practice the complete workflow with a second branch to simulate the performance comparison scenario above.

### Activity 4: Create a Second Branch for Comparison

You're still on `main`. Create a second branch for testing a "fast" approach:

```bash
git branch feature-fast
git switch feature-fast
```

**Create a fast version of the feature:**

```bash
cat > approach-fast.txt << 'EOF'
Solution Approach: Optimized
============================

Strategy: Performance-focused
- Use efficient algorithms
- Implement caching
- More complex structure

Performance Notes:
- Faster execution
- Higher memory usage
- Requires more testing
EOF
```

**Commit on this branch:**

```bash
git add approach-fast.txt
git commit -m "feat: add optimized approach with caching"
```

**Now you have two feature branches:**
- `feature-simple` (simple but basic)
- `feature-fast` (optimized but complex)

Both exist independently. Main is untouched. Both can be tested and evaluated in isolation.

---

### Activity 5: Testing and Decision

**In a real scenario**, you'd test both branches:
1. Switch to `feature-simple`, run tests, measure performance
2. Switch to `feature-fast`, run tests, measure performance
3. Compare results
4. Decide which is better for your needs

For this lesson, let's assume you tested both and `feature-fast` is superior due to caching.

**You decide: merge `feature-fast` into main.**

**Switch back to main first:**

```bash
git switch main
```

**Merge the winning branch:**

```bash
git merge feature-fast
```

**Expected output:**
```
Updating <hash>...<hash>
Fast-forward
 approach-fast.txt | 10 ++++++++++
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
```

**Observe:**
```bash
git log --oneline
```

You see commits from both main and the merged branch. The fast feature is now part of main.

---

### Activity 6: Clean Up Completed Experiments

The `feature-fast` branch served its purpose. Clean it up:

```bash
git branch -d feature-fast
```

**What happened?** The branch pointer is deleted. The commit is still in main's history (merged), so no data is lost. Git prevents you from deleting branches with unmerged changes (use `-D` only if certain).

**Verify cleanup:**

```bash
git branch
```

Now only `main` and `feature-simple` remain (the slow approach you didn't merge).

---

## Part 4: Understanding the Trade-offs—When to Branch vs Commit

You now understand how branches work. But when should you **branch** instead of just **committing**?

### Branches Are For:

- **Parallel experimentation** — Testing multiple AI suggestions simultaneously
- **Isolating risky changes** — If it breaks, you delete the branch, not the main code
- **Collaborative work** — Team members work on different branches without conflicts
- **Code review** — Changes are reviewed in a PR before merging

### Commits Are Better When:

- **You're confident in the direction** — AI has generated code you're sure about
- **Changes are incremental and proven** — Small improvements to existing functionality
- **You're alone on the project** — No need to isolate changes from collaborators

### Decision Framework:

**Ask yourself before each AI-assisted change:**

1. "Am I testing multiple approaches simultaneously?" → **Use branches**
2. "Could this break something critical?" → **Use branches**
3. "Is this a small, proven improvement?" → **Commit directly**
4. "Am I the only one working on this code?" → Can go either way, but branches are safer

## Part 5: Three Roles Summary—What Each of You Learned

Let's reflect on the complete Three Roles cycle you experienced:

### AI as Teacher

- **Taught you:** Branch naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, etc.)
- **Taught you:** Documentation patterns (metrics in commits and PRs)
- **Taught you:** Safe vs force-delete strategies
- **What you gained:** Structured approach to organizing experiments

### Student as Teacher

- **Taught AI:** Your constraint (branch clutter in previous project)
- **Taught AI:** Your preference (safe deletion over force-delete)
- **Taught AI:** Your documentation needs (metrics matter for decisions)
- **What AI gained:** Context-specific understanding of your workflow

### Co-Worker Convergence

- **Neither alone had:** Full performance documentation pattern (commit message + PR description)
- **Neither alone had:** Strategy for preventing branch clutter while testing thoroughly
- **Neither alone had:** Decision framework for when to branch vs commit
- **Together you created:** Reusable workflow for multi-option testing

## Part 6: Common Scenarios—Recognizing Your Pattern

You'll encounter these situations repeatedly. Now you have the tools:

### Scenario A: "AI gave me two ways to do this"

**What you do:**
1. Commit current main: `git commit -m "Before testing approaches"`
2. Create branch: `git branch approach-a`
3. Let AI implement approach-a on this branch
4. Test it
5. Switch to main: `git switch main`
6. Create another branch: `git branch approach-b`
7. Let AI implement approach-b
8. Test it
9. Compare and merge the better one

### Scenario B: "I'm not sure if this change is safe"

**What you do:**
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b experimental-feature`
2. Let AI generate the code
3. Test thoroughly
4. If it works: switch to main and merge
5. If it breaks: switch to main (experimental-feature is deleted, main untouched)

### Scenario C: "This is just a minor bug fix"

**What you do:**
1. Small, predictable fix → commit directly to main
2. Large or risky fix → create a branch, test, merge
3. When in doubt → branch (safer than sorry)

## Try With AI

**Setup:** Open ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) or your preferred AI assistant.

**Prompt Set:**

```
Prompt 1 (Naming conventions):
"What are good Git branch naming conventions for a Python project?
Show me examples for features, bug fixes, and experiments."

Prompt 2 (Workflow review):
"I'm testing two implementations of a feature on separate branches.
What's a good process for deciding between them and documenting the decision?"

Prompt 3 (Advanced):
"How would branch workflows change if I were working with a team
on the same project? What additional practices would matter?"
```

**Expected Outcomes:**

- **Prompt 1:** AI teaches you naming standards (feature/, bugfix/, etc.)
- **Prompt 2:** AI suggests documentation in PRs and commit messages
- **Prompt 3:** AI explains merge conflict prevention and code review patterns

Remember: AI might suggest advanced concepts (rebasing, squashing) beyond beginner level—for now, focus on simple branch creation and merging. Ask AI to explain in beginner terms if it uses technical jargon.

**Optional Stretch:**

Create three actual branches with different naming styles and merge one into main. Practice the full workflow: create → test → merge → delete.

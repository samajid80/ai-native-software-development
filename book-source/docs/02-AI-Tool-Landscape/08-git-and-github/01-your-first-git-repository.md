# Your First Git Repository

## Git as Your Safety Net

When you ask Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT to generate code, you're taking a risk. Will the code work? Will it break your project? How do you experiment fearlessly?

**This is where Git comes in.**

Git isn't about memorizing commands. It's about creating **save points** in your project. Imagine playing a video game where you can save before every boss fight, then reload if you die. That's what Git does for your code.

In this lesson, you'll create your first Git repository by executing commands and observing what happens. You won't write code yet—just create a simple project and watch Git build a safety net around it.

**By the end**, you'll understand:
- How to initialize Git (create that save point system)
- How to tell Git which files to protect
- How to create your first save point (commit)
- Why this matters for AI-assisted development

---

## Prerequisites: Installing Git

Before we begin, you need Git installed on your computer. Let's check if you already have it.

### Check if Git is Installed

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git --version
```

**If you see something like:**
```
git version 2.39.0
```

✅ **You're ready!** Skip to Phase 1 below.

**If you see an error** like `command not found: git`, follow the installation steps for your operating system:

### Installing Git

**macOS:**
```bash
# Option 1: Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install git

# Option 2: Install Xcode Command Line Tools (includes Git)
xcode-select --install
```

**Windows:**
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer
3. Use default settings (just keep clicking "Next")
4. Restart your terminal after installation

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S git
```

**Verify Installation:**

After installing, close and reopen your terminal, then run:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see a version number. Now you're ready!

---

## Phase 1: Execute - Initialize Your First Repository

Let's create a simple project folder and tell Git to protect it.

### Activity 1.1: Create a Project Folder

Open your terminal and create a new folder for your first project:

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
```

You've just created a folder called `my-first-project` and navigated into it. Right now, Git doesn't know about this folder yet.

### Activity 1.2: Initialize Git

Tell Git to start protecting this folder:

```bash
git init
```

**What you should see:**

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/yourname/my-first-project/.git/
```

(The exact path will differ on your computer, but the message will be similar.)

**What just happened?** Git created a hidden folder called `.git` inside your project. This folder is Git's workspace—it will store your entire project history, save points, and metadata.

### Observation Prompt

Look at your folder to see the hidden `.git` directory:

```bash
ls -la
```

**What this command does:**
- `ls` = list files in current directory
- `-l` = show detailed information (permissions, size, date)
- `-a` = show **all** files, including hidden ones (those starting with `.`)

**You should see:**

```
total 0
drwxr-xr-x@  3 user   staff    96 Nov 17 14:48 .
drwxrwxrwt  39 root   wheel  1248 Nov 17 14:48 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  9 user   wheel   288 Nov 17 14:48 .git
```

**Discovery Question**: "What does the `.git` folder represent?"

**Answer**: It's Git's repository database. Everything Git tracks—your entire project history—lives in that folder. Delete `.git` and you lose all your save points. Keep it safe.

---

## Phase 2: Observe - Understand What Git Sees

Now let's create some project files and see how Git views them.

### Activity 2.1: Create Sample Files

In your project folder, create two simple text files:

```bash
echo "Hello, World! This is my first project." > hello.txt
echo "My First Project - Experimenting with AI" > README.md
```

**What these commands do:**
- `echo` = print text to the screen (or in this case, into a file)
- `>` = redirect the text into a new file (creates the file if it doesn't exist)
- `hello.txt` and `README.md` = the filenames we're creating

**Result**: You've created two files with text inside them. Git doesn't know about them yet.

### Activity 2.2: Check Git Status

Ask Git what it sees in your project:

```bash
git status
```

**You should see:**

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md
        hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**Breaking Down This Output:**

| Section | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| `On branch main` | You're on the default branch (starting point) |
| `No commits yet` | You haven't created any save points yet |
| `Untracked files:` | Git sees these files, but hasn't started protecting them |
| `README.md, hello.txt` | The files Git found but isn't protecting |

**Discovery Question**: "What does 'untracked' mean?"

**Answer**: Git sees these files but hasn't committed to tracking them. They're like a visitor at a hotel—Git noticed them, but hasn't given them a room key yet.

---

## Phase 3: Understand - The Staging Area

Before creating a save point (commit), Git uses an intermediate zone called the **staging area** (sometimes called the "index"). Think of it as a checklist where you choose which files to include in your next save point.

### Activity 3.1: Stage the First File

Tell Git to protect `hello.txt`:

```bash
git add hello.txt
```

No output means it worked. Now check status again:

```bash
git status
```

**You should see:**

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        new file:   hello.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md
```

**What Changed?**

- `hello.txt` moved from "Untracked files" to "Changes to be committed" (shown in green)
- `README.md` is still untracked

**Discovery Question**: "What does the green text mean?"

**Answer**: Green files are staged—they're ready to be included in your next save point. Red/untracked files aren't ready yet.

### Activity 3.2: Stage the Second File

Add `README.md` to the staging area:

```bash
git add README.md
```

Check status again:

```bash
git status
```

**You should see:**

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        new file:   README.md
        new file:   hello.txt
```

**Discovery Question**: "Why would you stage some files but not others?"

**Answer**: Imagine you have personal notes in `notes.txt` that you don't want on GitHub. You'd stage `hello.txt` and `README.md` but leave `notes.txt` unstaged. Staging gives you control over what's protected.

---

## Phase 4: Apply - Create Your First Save Point

Now that both files are staged, you're ready to create your first save point.

### Activity 4.1: Create First Commit

Create your first save point with a meaningful message:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
git commit -m "Initial commit: first project files"
```

(Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual details.)

**You should see:**

```
[main (root-commit) 00b5fe3] Initial commit: first project files
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

**What happened:**
- ✅ Created your first save point (commit) on the `main` branch
- ✅ Git assigned it a unique ID: `00b5fe3`
- ✅ Both files are now protected in this save point

### Activity 4.2: Verify the Commit

Check your project's save point history:

```bash
git log
```

**You should see:**

```
commit 00b5fe326eb72875d854754e8cba6edf1ff3e5d6
Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 17 14:48:46 2025 +0500

    Initial commit: first project files
```

**Breaking Down the Log:**

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| `commit 00b5fe32...` | Unique identifier for this save point |
| `Author: Your Name` | Who created this save point |
| `Date:` | When the save point was created |
| `Initial commit:...` | The message describing the save point |

**Discovery Question**: "What just happened?"

**Answer**: You created a save point. Git has taken a snapshot of your project at this moment. If you make mistakes later, you can return to this exact state.

---

## Reflection: Why This Matters

**Pause and Reflect**

Take 2 minutes to answer these questions:

1. **What does a commit do?**
   - A: Saves a snapshot of your project at a specific moment with your message explaining the changes

2. **Why would you commit BEFORE asking AI to generate code?**
   - A: If the AI generates buggy code, you can return to this working save point. It's your safety net.

3. **How many save points would you create for a week of AI experimentation?**
   - A: As many as you need (daily, before major changes, after testing features). More save points = more safety.

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Definition | Why It Matters |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Git Repository** | Folder protected by Git (contains `.git` directory) | Creates version control system for your project |
| **Working Directory** | Your actual project files on disk | What you see and edit |
| **Untracked Files** | Files Git sees but hasn't started protecting | You must stage them before committing |
| **Staging Area** | Intermediate zone where you choose files to commit | Lets you control which files go in each save point |
| **Commit** | Save point with snapshot, message, author, timestamp | Enables you to return to working state if AI-generated code breaks things |

## Try With AI

You've now discovered Git fundamentals through hands-on execution. Let's test your understanding by asking an AI assistant to explain what you just did.

**Setup**: Open ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) in your browser. You'll have a conversation with ChatGPT about what you just learned.

**Prompt 1 (Check Understanding)**:

```
I just created my first Git repository and made my first commit.
I ran: git init, git add, and git commit.
Can you explain in simple terms what each of these commands does?
```

**Expected Outcome**: ChatGPT should explain:
- `git init` creates a Git repository
- `git add` stages files for the next commit
- `git commit` creates a save point with a message

**Prompt 2 (Test Staging Area Concept)**:

```
I'm confused about the staging area. Why doesn't Git just commit everything
automatically? Why do I need to run "git add" first?
```

**Expected Outcome**: ChatGPT should explain that staging lets you choose which files go in each commit, enabling more control and better organization of your project history.

**Prompt 3 (Connect to AI Safety)**:

```
How does creating commits help me when I'm working with AI-generated code?
```

**Expected Outcome**: ChatGPT should mention:
- Commits create save points before risky changes
- You can revert if AI-generated code breaks things
- Multiple commits allow you to experiment safely

**Verification**: If ChatGPT's answers match your understanding from this lesson, you've successfully learned the core concepts. If something doesn't match, ask ChatGPT to clarify, and then re-read the relevant section above. Remember: if ChatGPT's explanation doesn't match what you observed in this lesson, trust what you observed—Git's behavior doesn't lie.

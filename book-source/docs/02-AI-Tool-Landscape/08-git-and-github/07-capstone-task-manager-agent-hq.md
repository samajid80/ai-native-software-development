# Capstone: Task Manager + GitHub Agent HQ

Welcome to your capstone project! This is where everything you've learned in Lessons 1-6 comes together. You'll manage a complete Git workflow for an AI-generated multi-file project, then peek into GitHub's multi-agent orchestration future.

**What You'll Accomplish**:
- Write a **specification FIRST** (before any code exists)
- Ask AI to generate a complete Python CLI task manager from your spec
- Manage the entire Git workflow: init → commit → branch → test → merge → push → PR
- Apply your `git-workflow.md` patterns from Lesson 6 automatically
- Document AI assistance transparently in your pull request
- Understand GitHub Agent HQ as the platform evolution foundation

**Why This Matters**: This is proof you can manage AI-generated projects safely and professionally. You'll walk away with a portfolio-ready project on GitHub demonstrating both technical skills and transparent AI collaboration.

---

## Part A: The Capstone Project (90 minutes)

### Project Overview: Personal Task Manager CLI

You'll create a command-line task manager that:
- Adds tasks to a list
- Displays all tasks
- Marks tasks as complete
- Deletes tasks
- Persists tasks to JSON file

**Key Constraint**: You write the **specification first**, then AI generates code. This is Stage 4 (Spec-Driven Integration)—the highest level of AI-native development.

---

## Step 1: Write Specification BEFORE Code (20 minutes)

In AI-native development, the fundamental skill shifts from **writing code** to **writing specifications**. Specifications define **WHAT** your program does (intent, success criteria, constraints) WITHOUT saying **HOW** to implement it.

### Understanding Specification-First Development

**Traditional Approach (Pre-AI)**:
1. Think about implementation details
2. Write code directly
3. Test if it works
4. Debug and refine

**AI-Native Approach (Stage 4)**:
1. **Write specification** defining intent and success criteria
2. AI generates code from specification
3. Validate code against specification
4. Refine specification if needed

**Why Spec-First Wins**:
- Clear specifications → Quality AI output
- Vague specifications → Poor AI output
- Specifications are reviewable BEFORE code exists
- You validate AI's work against YOUR intent (not AI's assumptions)

### Create spec.md

Create a new directory for your project and write this specification:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir task-manager-capstone
cd task-manager-capstone

# Create specification file
# (Use your text editor - VS Code, Cursor, Zed, nano, or vim)
```

**File: `spec.md`**

```markdown
# Project: Personal Task Manager CLI

## Intent
Create a command-line task manager demonstrating Git workflow with AI-generated code. Students will manage real project using Git safety patterns learned in Lessons 1-6.

## Features
1. **Add Task**: User types task description, program adds to list
2. **View All Tasks**: Display numbered list of all tasks with completion status
3. **Mark Complete**: User provides task number, program marks as done
4. **Delete Task**: User provides task number, program removes it
5. **Persist to JSON**: All tasks saved to `tasks.json` file (survive program restart)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All features work without errors
- ✅ Tasks persist across program runs (stored in tasks.json)
- ✅ Program shows help text explaining commands
- ✅ User-friendly: clear prompts, handles invalid input gracefully

## Technical Constraints
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Data Storage**: JSON file (no database)
- **Interface**: Command-line only (no GUI)
- **Error Handling**: Validate user input, display helpful messages

## Non-Goals (What This Project Is NOT)
- ❌ Web interface (CLI only)
- ❌ Database integration (JSON sufficient)
- ❌ User authentication (single-user tool)
- ❌ Cloud sync (local storage only)
- ❌ Advanced features (priorities, due dates, categories deferred to v2)

## Validation Tests
After implementation, verify:
1. Add 3 tasks → Close program → Reopen → All 3 tasks still present
2. Mark task complete → Status changes
3. Delete task → Removed from list
4. Run with no tasks.json → Program creates file automatically
5. Type invalid command → Program shows helpful error (not crash)
```

**What You Just Did**: You defined WHAT the program does WITHOUT saying HOW to implement it. This is the specification that AI will use to generate code.

**Reflection**: Notice how much clarity this specification provides:
- AI knows exactly what to build
- You can validate AI's code against these criteria
- Specification is reviewable BEFORE any code exists
- Changes to specification are easier than changes to code

---

## Step 2: Initialize Git Repository (5 minutes)

Before AI generates code, create your Git safety net.

### Apply Pattern 1 from Lesson 6: "Commit Before Experiment"

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Create initial commit with specification
git add spec.md
git commit -m "Initial: project specification for task manager"
```

**Why This Order Matters**:
1. Specification exists and is committed
2. AI generates code based on this committed spec
3. If AI code is terrible, you can revert to specification-only state
4. Specification is source of truth (never lost)

**Verify**:
```bash
git log --oneline
# Should show: abc1234 Initial: project specification for task manager
```

---

## Step 3: AI Generates Code from Specification (15 minutes)

Now ask AI to implement your specification.

### The AI Generation Prompt

Open ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) and use this **specification-based prompt**:

```
I need a Python command-line task manager. Here's my complete specification:

[Paste your entire spec.md file here]

Generate complete working code following this specification exactly.
Include:
- Main program file (task_manager.py)
- All features listed in specification
- Error handling for invalid input
- Help text explaining commands
```

### Understanding AI's Role

**AI as Co-Worker**:
- You provided clear intent (specification)
- AI handles implementation details (code)
- You validate output against YOUR success criteria

AI should generate something like:

**File: `task_manager.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Save this code** to `task_manager.py` in your project directory.

---

## Step 4: Commit AI-Generated Code (5 minutes)

Apply Pattern 1 from your git-workflow.md: **Commit before testing** (creates restore point).

```bash
# Stage AI-generated files
git add task_manager.py

# Commit with AI attribution
git commit -m "feat: AI-generated task manager skeleton

AI: ChatGPT generated complete task manager from spec.md
Features: add, list, complete, delete tasks with JSON persistence
Validation: Not yet tested (next step)"
```

**What This Commit Message Shows**:
- **Type**: `feat:` (new feature using conventional commits)
- **What**: AI-generated task manager skeleton
- **Attribution**: Clear AI transparency (ChatGPT generated from spec)
- **Status**: Validation pending

**Git History Now**:
```
* abc5678 feat: AI-generated task manager skeleton
* abc1234 Initial: project specification for task manager
```

---

## Step 5: Test & Create Improvement Branch (15 minutes)

Test all features from your specification.

### Validation Against Spec

```bash
# Make executable (macOS/Linux)
chmod +x task_manager.py

# Run program
python3 task_manager.py
```

**Test Checklist** (from spec.md success criteria):
```
> help
[Should show command list]

> add Buy groceries
[Should add task #1]

> add Finish homework
[Should add task #2]

> list
[Should show 2 tasks, both incomplete]

> complete 1
[Should mark task #1 done]

> list
[Task #1 should show ✓, task #2 should show  ]

> quit
[Exit program]

# Restart and verify persistence
python3 task_manager.py
> list
[Both tasks should still be there]

> delete 2
[Should remove task #2]

> list
[Only task #1 remains]
```

**Validation Result**: ✅ All success criteria met!

### Apply Pattern 2: "Branch for Improvements"

Even though basic features work, you might want to add better error handling or improve the user experience. Create a branch to test improvements safely.

```bash
# Create improvement branch
git checkout -b feature/better-error-handling

# Make improvement (example: add input validation)
# [Edit task_manager.py to add more helpful error messages]

# Commit improvement
git add task_manager.py
git commit -m "feat: enhanced input validation and error messages"
```

**Pattern Recognition**: You just applied the **branch-test-merge** pattern from Lesson 6 automatically without referring back to lessons. This is intelligence accumulation!

---

## Step 6: Merge and Push to GitHub (15 minutes)

### Merge Feature Branch to Main

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge improvement branch
git merge feature/better-error-handling

# View history
git log --oneline --graph
```

**Expected Output**:
```
* def9012 feat: enhanced input validation and error messages
* abc5678 feat: AI-generated task manager skeleton
* abc1234 Initial: project specification for task manager
```

### Apply Pattern 3: "Push for Backup"

```bash
# First time: Create GitHub repository
# 1. Go to github.com
# 2. Click "New repository"
# 3. Name: task-manager-capstone
# 4. Keep it Public (for portfolio)
# 5. DO NOT initialize with README (you already have commits)

# Connect local to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/task-manager-capstone.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Also push feature branch (shows your process)
git push origin feature/better-error-handling
```

**Verify on GitHub**: Visit your repository page. You should see:
- ✅ 3 commits in history
- ✅ spec.md, task_manager.py, tasks.json
- ✅ Both branches visible
- ✅ Code viewable by anyone (portfolio ready)

---

## Step 7: Create Pull Request with AI Transparency (10 minutes)

This is your professional documentation of the complete project.

### Create PR on GitHub

1. **On GitHub**: Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Compare**: `feature/better-error-handling` → `main`
3. **Create PR** with this template:

**Title**: `feat: Enhanced task manager with better error handling`

**Description**:

---

## Part B: GitHub Agent HQ Awareness (30 minutes)

Now that you've mastered Git for single-agent development (you + ChatGPT), let's explore GitHub's evolution into a **multi-agent orchestration platform**.

---

## Understanding GitHub Agent HQ: The Platform Evolution

### What You Just Learned vs. What's Coming

**What You Learned (Lessons 1-7)**:
- You work with ONE AI at a time (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini)
- You manually manage Git workflow (init, commit, branch, push, PR)
- You coordinate AI's work through prompts
- Git is YOUR safety system for managing AI's code

**What's Emerging (GitHub Agent HQ)**:
- GitHub orchestrates MULTIPLE AI agents on SAME project
- Agents create branches, commits, and PRs automatically
- GitHub coordinates which agent does what
- Git becomes the coordination layer for agent collaboration

**Key Insight**: The Git skills you learned (branches, commits, PRs, remotes) don't change. GitHub is adding an orchestration layer on TOP of Git fundamentals.

---

## GitHub Agent HQ: 5 Core Concepts

### 1. Mission Control: Unified Interface for Multiple AI Agents

**What It Is**:
GitHub Agent HQ provides a **mission control interface** where you direct multiple AI agents from one place instead of switching between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

**Analogy**: Instead of texting three friends separately to plan dinner, you create a group chat where everyone sees the conversation.

**How It Works**:
```
You (mission control): "Implement authentication system"

GitHub Agent HQ dispatches:
- Agent A (Claude Code): Creates database schema on branch `db/auth-schema`
- Agent B (GPT-4): Implements login API on branch `api/login`
- Agent C (Gemini): Writes tests on branch `tests/auth`

All agents work in parallel, coordinated by GitHub.
```

**Why This Matters**: You describe intent ONCE. GitHub coordinates which specialized agent handles each piece. Faster than sequential single-agent work.

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration: Specialized Agents Working Together

**What It Is**:
Different AI agents have different strengths (Claude excels at reasoning, GPT-4 at code generation, Gemini at multi-modal). Agent HQ lets them work on the SAME project simultaneously, each doing what it does best.

**Analogy**: Instead of one general contractor building your house, you have specialized electrician, plumber, and carpenter working in parallel.

**How It Relates to Your Learning**:
- **You learned**: Create branch → AI generates code → You test → Merge
- **Agent HQ does**: Create branches for multiple agents → Agents generate code in parallel → GitHub coordinates merging

**The Branches You Learned = Agent Coordination**:
- You learned branches isolate experiments
- Agent HQ uses branches to isolate agent work
- Same Git concept, scaled to multiple agents

### 3. Branch Controls for Agent-Generated Code

**What It Is**:
GitHub enforces policies on branches that agents create (e.g., "Agent-generated branches require tests before merge").

**Analogy**: Like having safety rails on agent work—agents can't merge directly to main without passing checks.

**How It Works**:
```
Agent creates branch: agent-a/new-feature
Agent commits code
GitHub automatically:
  - Runs tests
  - Checks code quality
  - Verifies security
  - Requires human approval if critical

Only then: Agent's PR can merge
```

**Why This Matters**: Agents get speed of automation + safety of human oversight. You stay in control.

### 4. Agentic Code Review: AI Reviewing AI

**What It Is**:
GitHub's CodeQL engine automatically reviews agent-generated pull requests for security issues, bugs, and code quality BEFORE human review.

**Analogy**: Like spell-check catching typos before you send an email. CodeQL catches code issues before you review.

**How It Works**:
```
Agent creates PR → CodeQL reviews → Flags issues:
  - "SQL injection vulnerability detected"
  - "Unused variable on line 42"
  - "Function complexity too high"

Agent fixes issues automatically → Human reviews cleaned code
```

**Why This Matters**: You review fewer low-level bugs because AI reviewers catch them first. You focus on intent and architecture.

### 5. Platform Evolution: GitHub as AI Coordination Layer

**What It Is**:
GitHub is transforming from "place to store code" to "platform that coordinates AI agents building software."

**Historical Context**:
- **2008-2020**: GitHub = Code hosting + version control
- **2020-2023**: GitHub = Code + CI/CD + Copilot (single-agent assistance)
- **2024+**: GitHub = Code + Multi-agent orchestration (Agent HQ)

**Analogy**: GitHub evolved like AWS evolved:
- AWS started as "rent a server"
- AWS became "platform for building cloud applications"
- GitHub started as "store your code"
- GitHub becoming "platform for coordinating AI development"

**Your Role Evolution**:
- **Before AI**: Write code yourself
- **Single Agent (Today)**: Write spec → AI generates code → You validate
- **Multi-Agent (Agent HQ)**: Write spec → GitHub coordinates multiple agents → You validate

**What Stays the Same**:
- Git fundamentals (branches, commits, PRs, merges)
- Specification-driven development (WHAT before HOW)
- Human validation (you approve merges)
- Safety via version control (can always undo)

**What Changes**:
- Speed (multiple agents work in parallel)
- Specialization (right agent for right task)
- Scale (agents handle larger projects)

## How This Relates to Your Learning

### Foundation Skills Don't Change

**What You Learned in Lessons 1-6**:
- Git repositories, commits, branches
- Staging area, history, diffs
- GitHub remotes, push, pull, clone
- Pull requests, code review, merges

**These Skills Apply to Agent HQ**:
- Agents use branches (you understand branches)
- Agents create commits (you understand commits)
- Agents create PRs (you understand PRs)
- You approve agent merges (using PR review skills)

**Key Message**: You're learning the foundation that works FOREVER. Agent HQ is additive, not disruptive.

### You're Prepared for the Multi-Agent Future

**Skills You Have Now** (that translate to Agent HQ):
1. ✅ **Specification Writing**: Agent HQ needs clear specs (you practiced in this lesson)
2. ✅ **Branch Management**: Agents create branches (you know how branches work)
3. ✅ **Code Review**: You validate agent PRs (you know how to review diffs)
4. ✅ **Git Safety**: You know undo operations (works same with agent-generated code)
5. ✅ **AI Transparency**: You document AI assistance (critical for multi-agent workflows)

**What You'll Add When Agent HQ Is Production-Ready**:
- Learn mission control interface (like learning GitHub's UI when you first started)
- Configure agent policies (which agents can do what)
- Orchestrate agent coordination (assigning work to specialized agents)

**Estimate**: If you're comfortable with Git now (Lessons 1-7), you'll be comfortable with Agent HQ in 2-3 hours of practice. Foundation is 90% of the work.

---

## You're Prepared—Don't Let Platform Evolution Cause Anxiety

### Common Fear: "Will My Skills Become Obsolete?"

**Reality Check**:
- Git hasn't changed fundamentally since 2005 (20 years)
- Branches, commits, merges, remotes still work identically
- Agent HQ builds ON Git (doesn't replace it)
- Your mental model of Git applies directly to agent coordination

**Analogy**: When smartphones added group chats, you didn't relearn texting. You applied texting skills to groups. Same concept here.

---

### Timeline: When Does This Matter?

**Today (2025)**:
- Focus on mastering single-agent Git workflows (what you just did)
- GitHub Agent HQ is in limited preview (not widely available)

## Try With AI

**Setup**: Open ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) and explore the multi-agent coordination concept further.

**Prompt Set**:

```
Prompt 1: Foundational Understanding
"I just completed a Git capstone project where I managed an AI-generated task manager. I learned about GitHub Agent HQ. Can you explain how my Git skills (branches, commits, PRs) would apply if three AI agents were working on my project simultaneously?"

Prompt 2: Specification for Multi-Agent Scenario
"Here's a project specification: [paste your task manager spec.md]. If GitHub Agent HQ had three specialized agents (one for data handling, one for UI, one for testing), how would they divide this work using Git branches?"

Prompt 3: Future Preparation
"What should I focus on mastering NOW (in 2025) to be ready for GitHub Agent HQ when it becomes generally available? What skills are foundational vs. what can I learn later?"
```

**Expected Learning Outcome**:

After exploring with AI, you should understand:

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination Benefits**: Multiple AI agents working in parallel (Claude on database, GPT-4 on API, Gemini on tests) complete projects faster than sequential single-agent work. GitHub coordinates which agent works on which branch.

2. **Git Fundamentals Transfer**: The branches, commits, and pull requests you learned work identically with multiple agents. Agent A creates branch `db/schema`, Agent B creates `api/endpoints`, Agent C creates `tests/integration`—same Git concepts you practiced, scaled to multiple agents.

3. **Your Role Evolution**: You shift from "write specification → one AI generates code → you validate" to "write specification → GitHub coordinates multiple agents → you validate integrated result." Validation skills stay critical.

4. **Mission Control Interface**: GitHub Agent HQ provides unified dashboard where you assign work to agents, monitor progress, and approve merges—similar to how you review pull requests now, but with agent orchestration added.

5. **No Obsolescence Anxiety**: Git fundamentals (Lessons 1-7) remain unchanged. Agent HQ adds orchestration convenience on top. If you're comfortable with Git workflows now, you'll adapt to Agent HQ in hours (not months). Focus on mastering specifications and Git safety—these skills are permanent foundations.

Remember: Agent HQ is aspirational (not yet GA)—focus on mastering specification-driven development and Git workflows today. Agent HQ will be an evolution, not a revolution.

**Optional Stretch**: Ask AI to generate a multi-agent project plan for a more complex application (e.g., web app with frontend, backend, database, tests). Have AI specify which specialized agent would handle which component and how branches would coordinate their work. This thought experiment deepens your understanding of multi-agent orchestration benefits without requiring Agent HQ access.

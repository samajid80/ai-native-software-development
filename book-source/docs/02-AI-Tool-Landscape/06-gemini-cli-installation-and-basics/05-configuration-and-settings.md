# Configuration & Settings

**Duration**: 15-17 minutes

One of the biggest advantages of Gemini CLI being open source and command-line based is that you can configure it exactly how you need. Unlike web interfaces where settings are fixed, Gemini CLI offers a powerful configuration system that lets you customize behavior globally, by project, or even with environment-specific secrets.

In this lesson, you'll learn how Gemini CLI's configuration hierarchy works—and why it matters that your project settings can override your global settings.

---

## Part 1: The Configuration Hierarchy

Gemini CLI doesn't just read one configuration file. Instead, it checks **7 different levels** and merges them in order, with higher levels overriding lower ones.

Here's the complete precedence order (highest to lowest priority):

| Level | Location | Scope | Use Case |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Highest) | CLI flags | Command-specific | Override everything for one command |
| 2 | Environment variables | Session-specific | Temporary overrides (e.g., `export GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro`) |
| 3 | `.env` file | Project-specific | Project secrets and variables |
| 4 | Project settings | Project-specific | Project-level configuration |
| 5 | Workspace settings | Workspace-specific | Shared across multiple projects |
| 6 | User settings | User-specific | Your personal defaults |
| 7 (Lowest) | System settings | Machine-wide | System administrator settings |

**Key Rule**: If a setting exists at a higher level, it completely overrides the same setting at a lower level.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you have:
- **System level**: `model: gemini-2.5-pro`
- **User level**: `model: gemini-2.5-flash` (you prefer the faster model)
- **Project level**: `model: gemini-2.5-pro` (your team needs the more powerful model for this project)

When you run `gemini` in that project directory, it uses **`gemini-2.5-pro`** because the project level overrides the user level, which overrides the system level.

If you add a CLI flag: `gemini --model gemini-2.5-pro-128k`, that flag wins—it's the highest priority.

## Part 2: File Locations and Structure

**Configuration files are stored in JSON format**:

```
~/.gemini/settings.json          (User level - your personal settings)
<workspace-root>/.gemini/settings.json    (Workspace level)
<project-root>/.gemini/settings.json      (Project level)
```

On Windows:
```
C:\Users\<username>\.gemini\settings.json
```

### Basic Configuration File Structure

```json
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
  "auth": {
    "method": "google",
    "persistTokens": true
  },
  "checkpointing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 300000
  }
}
```

:::tip Verified Configuration
This JSON structure has been validated in Gemini CLI 0.15.0. All keys (`theme`, `model`, `auth`, `checkpointing`) are confirmed working configuration options.
:::

:::note MCP Server Configuration
You can also configure **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** in `settings.json` to connect Gemini CLI to external tools, databases, and APIs. We'll cover this in detail in the next lesson ([MCP Servers & Integration](./06-mcp-servers-and-integration.md)). For now, just know that `mcpServers` is a valid configuration section.
:::

The most important part for beginners: **You usually don't need to edit this file directly**. Configuration is often managed through environment variables and the `.env` file, which we'll cover next.

---

## Part 3: Environment Variables and .env Files

Environment variables are powerful because they're:
1. **Easy to share**: Commit `.env` to `.gitignore` to protect secrets, but keep the `.env` pattern in version control
2. **Language-agnostic**: Work with Python, Node.js, or any tool
3. **CI/CD friendly**: Easy to set in deployment pipelines

### Syntax in Configuration Files

Inside `settings.json`, you can reference environment variables using two syntaxes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myDatabase": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "database_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "${DB_CONNECTION_STRING}",
        "API_KEY": "$EXTERNAL_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Both `${VAR_NAME}` (preferred, explicit) and `$VAR_NAME` (shorthand) work.

:::note Environment Variable Syntax
Both syntaxes are verified working: `${DB_URL}` and `$DB_URL`. The `${VAR}` syntax is recommended for clarity.
:::

### The .env File

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Database connection
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=sk-abc123xyz789

# Gemini CLI defaults
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
GEMINI_THEME=dark
```

**Loading Order**:
1. Gemini CLI reads your `.env` file first
2. It merges with environment variables already set
3. Those override settings in `settings.json`
4. CLI flags override everything

### The CRITICAL Security Rule

**NEVER commit secrets to version control.**

Always:
1. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:
```
# .gitignore
.env
.env.local
*.key
```

2. Create a `.env.example` file showing the structure:
```
# .env.example (safe to commit)
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This way, team members know what variables are needed without exposing real secrets.

## Part 4: Common Configuration Parameters

Here are the settings you'll use most often:

:::tip All Parameters Verified
All configuration parameters shown below have been tested and verified in Gemini CLI 0.15.0.
:::

### Theme Selection
```json
{
  "theme": "dark"    // Options: "dark", "light", "auto"
}
```

### Model Selection
```json
{
  "model": "gemini-2.5-pro"    // Default model for sessions
}
```

### Auto-Save Sessions (Checkpointing)
```json
{
  "checkpointing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 300000    // Auto-save every 5 minutes (milliseconds)
  }
}
```

### Authentication Method
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "method": "google",    // Options: "google", "apiKey", "vertexAI"
    "persistTokens": true  // Keep you logged in across sessions
  }
}
```

### Custom API Endpoint (Advanced)
```json
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://custom-gemini-api.example.com/v1"
}
```

## Part 5: Security Best Practices

Here's a practical workflow for keeping your project secure:

### ✅ DO:
- Use environment variables for API keys, database URLs, and secrets
- Store sensitive values in `.env` files
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with structure only
- Rotate API keys periodically

### ⚠️ DON'T:
- Hardcode secrets in `settings.json`
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Use the same API key across multiple projects
- Leave API keys in shell history

### Example: Safe Configuration Setup

**Your `.gemini/settings.json`** (project level, safe to commit):
```json
{
  "model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
  "mcpServers": {
    "myDatabase": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "database_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "${DATABASE_URL}",
        "API_KEY": "${DATABASE_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Your `.env`** (project root, in .gitignore):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod-db.example.com:5432/myapp
DATABASE_API_KEY=sk-secret-key-xyz789
```

**Result**: When you run `gemini`, it:
1. Loads variables from `.env`
2. Replaces `${DATABASE_URL}` with the actual connection string
3. Connects to your database safely
4. No secrets in version control ✅

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> The `.env` + `.gitignore` + `.env.example` pattern is universal across all modern development (Python, Node.js, Go, Rust). Learn it once with Gemini CLI, apply it everywhere. This is why AI-driven learning emphasizes transferable patterns over tool-specific tricks.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I have a Gemini CLI project with a PostgreSQL database connection. Create a complete secure configuration setup including: 1) settings.json with environment variable references, 2) .env file with example secrets, 3) .env.example template, and 4) .gitignore entries. Make sure no secrets end up in version control."
>
> **Expected Outcome**: Complete, copy-paste-ready configuration that follows security best practices.

## Red Flags to Watch

### "Configuration not found"
- Check file path: `~/.gemini/settings.json` (macOS/Linux) or `C:\Users\<username>\.gemini\settings.json` (Windows)
- Create the file if it doesn't exist
- Format must be valid JSON (no trailing commas, quotes around keys)

### "Variable not found: DATABASE_URL"
- Check your `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify variable name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure Gemini CLI can read the file (not hidden or permission-restricted)

### "Connection refused" (MCP server error)
- MCP server environment variables may be missing
- Check all required variables are in `.env`
- Run MCP server manually to see specific error

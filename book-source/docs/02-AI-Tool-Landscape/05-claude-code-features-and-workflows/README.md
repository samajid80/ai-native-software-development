# Chapter 5: How It All Started — The Claude Code Phenomenon

You know *why* AI-driven development matters—and that it's happening right now, in 2025. But understanding transformation and experiencing it are two different things. 

This chapter introduces you to the first real tool you'll use: Claude Code. Not as abstract theory, but as a working development partner on your machine.

The goal is **not to build a supercomputer**, but to establish Claude Code as your **collaborative thinking partner** for everything.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll have:

1. **The Paradigm Shift** (Lesson 1) — Understanding how agentic AI (Claude Code) differs fundamentally from passive chat-based tools through context-aware, file-integrated collaboration

2. **Claude Code Installed & Working** (Lesson 2) — Complete setup on Windows/macOS/Linux with 4 installation methods, authentication, and first successful commands

3. **Persistent Project Context** (Lesson 3) — Creating CLAUDE.md files that eliminate repetitive context-sharing in every session

4. **External Integration** (Lesson 4) — MCP servers for safe access to external systems (web, APIs, docs) with practical Playwright and Context7 workflows

5. **Subagent Orchestration** (Lesson 5) — Recognizing when Claude automatically delegates to Explore agent (codebase search) or Plan mode (complex tasks) with hands-on exercises

6. **Autonomous Expertise** (Lesson 6) — Agent Skills with progressive disclosure pattern (metadata → full definition → supporting files) and autonomous discovery

7. **Event-Driven Automation** (Lesson 7) — Hooks for custom behaviors triggered by events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart) with hands-on SessionStart hook creation

8. **Configuration Mastery** (Lesson 8) — Settings hierarchy (User, Project, Local) and precedence rules for team collaboration and personal customization

9. **Complete Extensibility** (Lesson 9) — Discovering and using plugins from marketplaces, hands-on installation of Anthropic's official skills repository

Let's get a fully personalized, extensible AI companion ready for sophisticated AI-Driven Development workflows throughout the course

## Stage Progression: L1→L2→L3→L4

This chapter follows the **4-Layer Teaching Method**, where each lesson builds your capabilities progressively:

### Stage 1: Manual Foundation (Lessons 1-2)
**What**: Understand agentic AI and get Claude Code working on your machine
**Why**: You need to see how Claude Code differs from passive AI before we add complexity
**Lessons**:
- Lesson 1: Origin story and paradigm shift (mental model)
- Lesson 2: Installation and authentication (working tool)

### Stage 2: AI Collaboration (Lessons 3-7)
**What**: Learn each major feature while collaborating with Claude Code
**Why**: Each feature is more powerful with hands-on practice and Three Roles co-learning (AI teaches, you teach, convergence)
**Lessons**:
- Lesson 3: CLAUDE.md (persistent context—foundation for everything else)
- Lesson 4: MCP (external integrations via safe protocols)
- Lesson 5: Subagents (specialized assistants for complex tasks)
- Lesson 6: Skills (reusable capabilities you design)
- Lesson 7: Hooks (event-driven automation)

### Stage 3: Intelligence Design (Lesson 8)
**What**: Understand how to organize Claude Code for teams
**Why**: Configuration hierarchy enables shared standards (team settings) + personal customization (local settings)
**Lesson**:
- Lesson 8: Settings hierarchy (user/project/local precedence)

### Stage 4: Spec-Driven Integration (Lesson 9)
**What**: Discover and use plugins that compose everything from Lessons 1-8
**Why**: Capstone demonstrates that plugins = bundled skills + subagents + hooks + MCP = reusable organizational intelligence
**Lesson**:
- Lesson 9: Plugins from marketplace (composition pattern)

## How to Use This Chapter

**If you're new to Claude Code**: Follow Lessons 1-9 in order. Each builds on the previous.

**If you already have Claude Code**: Start with Lesson 3 (CLAUDE.md) to unlock context management, then choose features (Lessons 4-7) based on your workflow needs.

**If you're evaluating Claude Code for your team**: Review Lesson 8 (Settings) for team collaboration patterns and Lesson 9 (Plugins) for ecosystem extensibility.

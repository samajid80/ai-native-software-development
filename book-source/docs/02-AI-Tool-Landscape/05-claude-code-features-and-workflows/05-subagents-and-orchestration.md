# Subagents and Orchestration

You've installed Claude Code and tried basic commands. Now let's understand **subagents**—specialized AI assistants that help Claude Code handle complex tasks more effectively.

---

## The Problem: Context Clutter

Imagine you're working on a startup idea. You ask Claude Code to:
1. Research competitors in the market
2. Explain business model options
3. Find relevant industry reports
4. Draft a pitch deck outline

By request #4, Claude Code's conversation context is cluttered with research notes, explanations, and report summaries. The context is messy.

**Solution**: Instead of one AI trying to do everything, **specialized assistants (subagents)** handle focused tasks with clean, isolated context.

---

## What Are Subagents?

**Definition**: A subagent is a specialized AI assistant with its own instructions and isolated context window. Each subagent is an expert at one type of task.

Think of Claude Code as a project manager with a team of specialists:
- **Claude Code (main)**: Coordinates overall work
- **Plan subagent**: Researches your codebase and creates multi-step plans
- **Custom subagents**: You can create specialists for your team's specific needs (content planning, research synthesis, document structuring, etc.)

**Key benefit**: Each subagent has **clean context** (no clutter from other conversations) and **focused expertise** (specialized instructions for its task).

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Explain why subagents use isolated context windows instead of sharing the main conversation. What problems does context isolation solve?"

---

## Why This Matters: Specialized Expertise

**Workflow Impact**: Subagents let you delegate complex, multi-step tasks to specialists. Instead of a single AI trying to do everything, you have a team—one expert for research, one for code review, one for testing, one for documentation. Each maintains cleaner context, produces better results.

**Paradigm Connection**: This is the orchestration pattern in AI-driven development. Like a software architect delegating to specialists (frontend dev, backend dev, DBA), you orchestrate AI specialists. The main Claude Code session is your architect; subagents are your specialists.

**Real-World Context**: In production work, you'll create subagents for:
- Research-heavy tasks (gather requirements, analyze documentation)
- Specialized code reviews (security audits, performance optimization)
- Domain-specific work (database design, API integration, testing strategies)

Subagents are how you scale AI collaboration beyond single tasks.

---

## The Plan Subagent (Built-In)

Claude Code includes a **Plan subagent** that automatically activates for complex, multi-step tasks.

### When Plan Activates

When you ask for complex work, Claude Code delegates to the Plan subagent:

**You ask**: "Add user authentication to this project"

**Plan subagent does**:
1. **Researches your codebase** to understand current structure
2. **Creates a multi-phase plan**:
   - Phase 1: Database schema (users table, sessions)
   - Phase 2: Auth logic (password hashing, login/logout)
   - Phase 3: Integration (middleware, protect routes)
   - Phase 4: Testing (unit tests, flow validation)
3. **Presents plan for your approval** before any changes

### Why This Matters

**Without Plan subagent**: Claude might jump straight to code without understanding your project structure, missing dependencies or creating conflicts.

**With Plan subagent**: Research happens first, then a strategic plan, then execution—step by step.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, orchestration is a design skill, not a technical one. You don't memorize subagent commands—you recognize WHEN a task needs specialized focus vs general assistance. The `/agents` syntax is cheap; knowing when to delegate is gold.

---

## How Subagents Work

### The Execution Model: One Task, One Completion

**Critical concept**: A subagent is invoked **once** for a specific goal, completes its work, and **returns results to main Claude Code**.

**The flow**:
1. Main Claude Code recognizes a task that needs a specialist
2. Launches the subagent with a specific goal
3. Subagent works independently in isolated context
4. Subagent completes its task and returns results
5. **Control returns to main Claude Code**
6. You interact with main Claude Code to proceed

**Think of it like this**: You send a specialist to research something. They go off, do their work, come back with a report, and then you continue the conversation with your main assistant.

### Automatic Delegation

You don't command "use the Plan subagent." Claude Code decides when to delegate based on:
- Task complexity (multi-step tasks trigger Plan)
- Your request type (code review request might trigger a review subagent if you have one)
- Subagent descriptions (Claude matches task to specialist)

**Example**:
```
You: "Help me create a content marketing strategy for my startup"
Claude Code: *recognizes complexity, delegates to Plan subagent*
Plan subagent: *researches market, creates phase breakdown, returns plan*
Claude Code: *receives plan, presents it to you*
You: *approve or modify the plan*
Claude Code: *proceeds with execution*
```

### Explicit Invocation

You can also request a specific subagent directly:

```
You: "Use the startup-planner subagent to analyze my business model"
Claude Code: *invokes startup-planner, waits for results, presents findings*
```

---

## More Subagent Ideas

Once you understand the pattern, you can create subagents for any specialized task:

- **Research Subagents**: Deep-dive into documentation, gather requirements, analyze existing solutions
- **Code Review Subagents**: Security audits, performance analysis, pattern compliance checks
- **Testing Subagents**: Test strategy design, edge case generation, coverage analysis
- **Documentation Subagents**: API documentation, architecture diagrams, onboarding guides

**The pattern is always**:
1. Define the specialist's focus (what domain expertise does this subagent have?)
2. Identify key decisions (what autonomy does it need?)
3. Specify output format (how should results be delivered?)

You learned this pattern in Step 2.5 (Co-learn Subagent Design). Apply it to create any subagent your workflow needs.

For detailed subagent architecture, see `.claude/agents/` directory for real examples from this book's production system.

## Understanding Orchestration

**Orchestration** = AI coordinating multiple specialists toward a goal

When you ask for a complex task:
1. **Claude Code (orchestrator)** analyzes your request
2. **Launches a specialist subagent** (e.g., Plan subagent) for a specific goal
3. **Subagent completes its task** (researches, creates strategy) and **returns results**
4. **Control returns to main Claude Code**, which presents the results to you
5. **You approve/modify** the strategy
6. **Main Claude Code executes** step-by-step with your oversight

**Key insight**: Subagents don't stick around. They're invoked for one task, complete it, return results, and hand control back to main Claude Code.

**This is orchestration in action**: One AI managing a team of specialist AIs to accomplish complex work—each specialist does their job and returns the baton.

## Hands-On: Create Your First Custom Subagent

Creating a subagent is **easy**—Claude Code has a built-in workflow. Let's create a simple startup planning subagent together.

### Step 1: Launch the Agent Creation Workflow

In Claude Code, type:

```
/agents
```

**What you'll see**:
```
│ Agents                                                                        │
│ 9 agents                                                                      │
│                                                                               │
│ ❯ Create new agent                                                            │
│                                                                               │
│   Built-in agents (always available)                                         │
│   general-purpose · sonnet                                                   │
│   Explore · haiku                                                            │
│   Plan · sonnet                                                              │
```

Select **"Create new agent"**

### Step 2: Choose Location

```
│ Choose location                                                               │
│                                                                               │
│ ❯ 1. Project (.claude/agents/)                                                │
│   2. Personal (~/.claude/agents/)                                             │
```

**Choose 1** (Project) — this makes the agent available only in this project.

### Step 2.5: Co-learn Subagent Design (Optional but Recommended)

Before finalizing your subagent, collaborate with Claude Code to design it better.

**🤝 Practice Exercise: Three Roles Subagent Design**

Ask Claude Code:
```
I'm about to create a [YOUR PURPOSE] subagent. Before I finalize it,
help me think through:
1. What are 3 core decisions this subagent needs to make autonomously?
2. What questions should it ask users to gather the right context?
3. What principles should guide its recommendations?
```

**What happens in this collaboration**:

1. **AI as Teacher**: Claude suggests subagent design patterns you might not know
   - "For a code review subagent, consider asking about performance requirements"
   - "A documentation subagent should check existing style guides first"
   - "Testing subagents benefit from knowing your deployment environment"

2. **Student as Teacher**: You provide domain expertise Claude doesn't have
   - "In our codebase, we use [SPECIFIC PATTERN]"
   - "Our team has a strong preference for [APPROACH]"
   - "We've tried [X BEFORE] and it didn't work because [Y]"

3. **Convergence**: Together you design a subagent that's better than either of you would create alone
   - Not generic (Claude's default patterns)
   - Not overly specific (your initial idea)
   - But optimized for YOUR workflow and team needs

**This co-learning makes subagents more useful**. Instead of copying examples, you understand WHY certain design choices matter.

**Try this now** before completing your subagent creation.

### Step 3: Choose Creation Method

```
│ Creation method                                                               │
│                                                                               │
│ ❯ 1. Generate with Claude (recommended)                                       │
│   2. Manual configuration                                                     │
```

**Choose 1** — Let Claude generate the agent based on your description.

### Step 4: Describe Your Agent

```
│ Describe what this agent should do and when it should be used                │
│                                                                               │
│ e.g., Help me plan a content marketing strategy...                           │
```

**Type this**:
```
Help me plan startup ideas: research competitors, analyze business models,
identify market gaps, and suggest go-to-market strategies.
Use this when I ask "help me plan a startup" or "analyze this business idea."
```

Press **Enter**.

### Step 5: Claude Generates the Agent

```
│ ✽  Generating agent from description...                                      │
```

Claude Code creates:
- Agent name: `startup-planner`
- Instructions based on your description
- Tool permissions (WebSearch, Read)
- Saves to `.claude/agents/startup-planner.md`

### Step 6: Test Your New Subagent

Now test it! In Claude Code, say:

```
Use the startup-planner subagent to analyze this business idea:
"A platform that connects freelance writers with small businesses"
```

**What happens**:
1. Main Claude Code launches your `startup-planner` subagent
2. Subagent researches competitors, analyzes the market
3. Subagent completes its analysis and returns findings
4. Control returns to main Claude Code
5. Main Claude presents the business plan to you

**Key insight**: You just created a reusable specialist that you can invoke anytime with a simple request.

## Where Subagents Live

Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

**Project-level**: `.claude/agents/` (specific to this project)
**User-level**: `~/.claude/agents/` (available across all your projects)

**Example subagent file structure**:
```markdown
---
name: startup-planner
description: Analyzes business ideas and creates go-to-market strategies
model: sonnet
color: purple
---

# Startup Planning Instructions

When analyzing a business idea:
1. Research competitors and market size
2. Identify unique value propositions
3. Suggest business model options
4. Create go-to-market strategy
...
```

---

## What You Can Do Now

**YOU JUST LEARNED**:
- ✅ What subagents are (specialized AI assistants)
- ✅ How the execution model works (one task, one completion)
- ✅ How to use the built-in Plan subagent (automatic)
- ✅ How to create your first custom subagent (via `/agents`)
- ✅ How to invoke subagents explicitly
- ✅ Where subagents are stored (`.claude/agents/`)

**PRACTICE NOW**:
- Create 2-3 custom subagents for your workflow
- Try the Test Generator, Documentation Writer, or Bug Hunter examples
- Invoke them explicitly: "Use the [name] subagent to..."

---

## Try With AI

Open Claude Code and complete these hands-on exercises:

### Exercise 1: Create Your Own Subagent

Follow the hands-on steps from earlier in this lesson:

1. Type `/agents`
2. Choose "Create new agent"
3. Choose "Project" location
4. Choose "Generate with Claude"
5. Describe what it should do (try Blog Writer, Learning Guide, or Meeting Notes Organizer)
6. Test your new subagent by invoking it explicitly

**Expected outcome**: You'll have a working custom subagent stored in `.claude/agents/` that you can invoke anytime.

### Exercise 2: Trigger the Plan Subagent

```
I want to create a 6-month content marketing plan for my startup.
Create a strategy showing the phases and what each phase includes.
```

**Expected outcome**: Plan subagent researches content strategies, then presents a multi-phase breakdown (audience research → content pillars → production schedule → distribution). Observe the subagent working, then returning control to main Claude Code.

### Exercise 3: Test Your Custom Subagent

If you created a startup-planner subagent in Exercise 1:

```
Use the startup-planner subagent to analyze this business idea:
"A mobile app that helps people find and book local fitness classes"
```

**Expected outcome**: Your custom subagent launches, researches the market, returns findings to main Claude Code, which presents them to you. You'll see the one-task, one-completion pattern in action.

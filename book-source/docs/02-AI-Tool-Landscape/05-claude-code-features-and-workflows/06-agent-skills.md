# Agent Skills: Teaching Claude New Capabilities

## The Problem: Repeating Yourself Across Sessions

You're working with Claude Code on multiple blog posts this week. Every time you start a new session, you give the same instructions:

"Create an outline with 5 main sections, suggest 5 headline variations, make the introduction hook readers in the first sentence, keep paragraphs under 4 sentences..."

By the third blog post, you're frustrated. **Why can't Claude just remember how you like blog posts structured?**

You could use a subagent—but that requires explicitly saying "Use the blog-planner subagent" every time. What if Claude could **automatically** apply your blog-planning workflow whenever you mention writing a blog post?

**That's what Skills solve.**

---

## What Are Agent Skills?

**Definition**: An Agent Skill is a **reusable capability** that extends Claude Code's knowledge in specific domains. When Claude recognizes the context (like "write a blog post"), it automatically loads and applies the skill's instructions.

**Think of skills as**: Teaching materials that Claude can reference when needed—like giving Claude a handbook on "how I want blog posts structured."

**Key characteristic**: Skills are **discovered autonomously**. You create the skill once (SKILL.md file), and Claude applies it automatically when relevant—no explicit invocation needed.

### How Skills Differ from Subagents

| Aspect | Subagents | Skills |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Context** | Separate (isolated conversation) | Shared (main conversation) |
| **Invocation** | Hard ("Use X subagent" guaranteed) | Soft (Claude decides when relevant) |
| **Best For** | Complex, isolated tasks | Lightweight, repeatable capabilities |
| **File Location** | `.claude/agents/name.md` | `.claude/skills/name/SKILL.md` |

**Key Difference**: Subagents run in separate context windows with guaranteed invocation. Skills run in the main conversation and activate automatically when Claude detects relevance.

**Use skills when**: Task is simple, repeatable, and doesn't need context isolation (blog planning, PDF extraction, note organizing)

**Use subagents when**: Task is complex, needs guaranteed execution, or requires separate context (multi-step refactoring, comprehensive audits)

---

## How Skills Work: The Three-Level Architecture

Skills use a three-level loading system:

**Level 1: Brief Summary (Always Loaded)**
When Claude Code starts, it sees short descriptions of all available skills. This helps Claude know WHEN to use each skill without loading full instructions.

**Level 2: Full Instructions (On-Demand)**
When Claude decides a skill is relevant, it loads the complete SKILL.md file with detailed instructions, workflows, and examples.

**Level 3: Supporting Files (If Needed)**
Skills can bundle scripts, reference docs, or tools in their directory. Claude accesses these when executing the skill.

**Example Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md                 # Main instructions
├── scripts/
│   └── pdf_extractor.py     # Python extraction tool
└── reference/
    └── pdf-standards.md     # Technical specs
```

**For your first skill**: Focus on Level 2 (SKILL.md with clear instructions). Add Level 3 (supporting files) only if your skill needs external tools or reference material.

---

## When Claude Code Invokes Skills Automatically

Three patterns trigger skill activation:

1. **Content Type Recognition**: Upload PDF → pdf-skill activates
2. **Task Request Recognition**: "Write a blog post" → blog-writer-skill activates
3. **Explicit Request**: "Use the blog-writer skill" → Direct activation

**To see available skills**: Ask Claude "What skills do you have?" in any session. Skills are discovered through conversation, not system commands.

## Hands-On: Create Your First Custom Skill

Let's create a blog planning skill.

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/blog-planner
```

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md File

Create `.claude/skills/blog-planner/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: "blog-planner"
description: "Help plan engaging blog posts: research topics, create outlines, suggest headlines, and draft compelling introductions. Use when user asks to plan or write blog content."
version: "1.0.0"
---

# Blog Planning Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "plan a blog post" or "write an article"
- User mentions blog topics, headlines, or content strategy
- User needs help structuring written content

## How This Skill Works

1. **Research the topic**: Understand the subject and target audience
2. **Create outline**: Break topic into 3-5 main sections
3. **Suggest headlines**: Provide 5 compelling headline options
4. **Draft introduction**: Write an engaging first paragraph that hooks readers

## Output Format

Provide:
- **Topic Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview
- **Target Audience**: Who should read this?
- **Outline**: Numbered list of main sections
- **Headline Options**: 5 variations (descriptive, curiosity-driven, benefit-focused)
- **Introduction Draft**: 1-2 paragraph hook

## Example

**Input**: "Help me plan a blog post about sustainable living"

**Output**:
- **Topic Summary**: Practical sustainable living tips for busy professionals
- **Target Audience**: Working adults wanting eco-friendly lifestyle changes
- **Outline**:
  1. Why sustainable living matters now
  2. 5 easy swaps you can make today
  3. Long-term sustainable habits
  4. Common myths debunked
  5. Resources for deeper learning
- **Headlines**:
  1. "5 Sustainable Living Changes You Can Make This Weekend"
  2. "Busy Professional's Guide to Eco-Friendly Living"
  3. "Sustainable Living: Easier Than You Think"
- **Introduction**: "You care about the environment, but who has time for complicated lifestyle changes? Good news: sustainable living doesn't require upending your entire routine. These five simple swaps take less than an hour to implement—and they'll cut your environmental impact by 30%."
```

### Step 3: Test Your Skill

Start Claude Code (`claude`), then ask:
```
Help me plan a blog post about learning AI tools
```

Claude recognizes "blog post" trigger, loads the skill, and applies its workflow automatically.

### Step 4: 🤝 Refine Your Skill Through Co-Learning

Ask Claude to review your skill:
```
Review the blog-planner skill. What could be improved?
Suggest 2-3 specific enhancements.
```

**AI as Teacher**: Claude suggests improvements (better descriptions, additional sections)
**You as Teacher**: You specify your constraints ("headlines must be curiosity-driven, not clickbait")
**Convergence**: Together you refine the skill to match YOUR workflow

Test the updated skill to validate improvements.

## More Skill Ideas for Practice

Apply the same pattern to create these skills:

**Meeting Notes Organizer**:
```yaml
---
name: "meeting-notes-organizer"
description: "Transform messy meeting notes into structured summaries with action items, decisions, and follow-ups. Use when user shares meeting notes or transcripts."
---
```

**Learning Path Designer**:
```yaml
---
name: "learning-path-designer"
description: "Create structured learning plans for any topic with progressive difficulty, resource recommendations, and practice exercises. Use when user wants to learn a new subject."
---
```

**Code Review Skill**:
```yaml
---
name: "code-reviewer"
description: "Perform systematic code reviews checking security, performance, maintainability, and best practices. Use when user asks to review code."
---
```

Try creating one of these skills using the blog-planner template as your guide.

## Why This Matters: Reusable Organizational Capability

**Workflow Impact**: Skills transform one-time solutions into persistent organizational intelligence. Solve a problem once (code review pattern, documentation style, testing strategy), encode it as a skill, and your entire team benefits automatically.

**Paradigm Connection**: This is intelligence accumulation in action. Unlike code libraries (reuse implementation), skills reuse *reasoning patterns*. The "how to think about X" becomes transferable across projects.

**Real-World Application**: Production teams create skills for domain-specific code reviews (security, performance), architectural pattern enforcement (API design, error handling), and documentation standards.

**Link to Capstone**: In Lesson 9, you'll see how plugins bundle skills—turning your custom reasoning patterns into shareable marketplace capabilities.

## Example: How a Skill Works in Practice

**Scenario**: You need to extract invoice data from a PDF.

**What You Do**:
```
Extract these fields from invoice.pdf:
- Invoice number
- Date
- Total amount
- Vendor name
```

**What Happens (Behind the Scenes)**:
1. Claude reads system prompt: "pdf-skill available for PDF extraction"
2. Recognizes PDF context + extraction request
3. Loads full SKILL.md with extraction instructions
4. Executes the skill's workflow automatically
5. Returns structured data

**What You See**:
```
Extracted Invoice Details:
- Invoice #: INV-2024-00531
- Date: November 13, 2024
- Total: $2,450.00
- Vendor: Tech Solutions Inc.
```

You described what you wanted. Claude discovered the right skill and applied it automatically—no explicit commands needed.

## When to Use Skills vs Subagents vs Main Conversation

**Use Skills When**:
- Task is predictable and repeatable (PDF extraction, blog planning, note organizing)
- You want automatic application without explicit invocation
- Multiple similar tasks in a session

**Use Subagents When**:
- Task is complex with many context-sensitive variables
- You need guaranteed invocation and isolated context
- Task requires specialized, multi-step workflows

**Use Main Conversation When**:
- One-off, exploratory work
- Learning something new
- No specialized capability exists yet

---

## Reflection: From Commands to Intentions

Think about this paradigm shift:

**Traditional Development**:
- You know a command exists
- You type it explicitly: `pdf_extract --input file.pdf --output json`
- You manage tool invocation manually

**AI-Native Development with Skills**:
- You describe what you want: "Extract invoice data from this PDF"
- Claude discovers the right skill automatically
- The system handles tool invocation

This shift—from "command what exists" to "describe what you want"—is fundamental to AI-native development.

**Key Insight**: Skills don't just automate tasks. They encode *reasoning patterns* that make AI assistants smarter by default. When you create a skill, you're teaching Claude "how to think about" a domain, not just "what commands to run."

---

## Try With AI

**Setup**: Open Claude Code (`claude` command) for this activity.

**Prompt 1: Design a Custom Skill**
```
Think about a repeated task in your workflow (code reviews, meeting notes, documentation).
Design a skill for it:
- What's the skill name and description?
- When should Claude recognize it's relevant?
- What workflow should it follow?
Create the SKILL.md file structure.
```

**Prompt 2: Skill vs Subagent Decision**
```
Compare these two tasks:
Task A: Draft weekly blog posts (happens 3x/week)
Task B: Create comprehensive product launch strategy (one-time, complex)

For each: Should I build a Skill or Subagent? Why?
What's the tradeoff between automatic activation (skills) vs. guaranteed control (subagents)?
```

**Expected Outcomes**: You'll design a skill matching your workflow and understand when skills vs subagents apply.

**Best Practices Reference**: See Lesson 9 for comprehensive skill design patterns and common pitfalls.

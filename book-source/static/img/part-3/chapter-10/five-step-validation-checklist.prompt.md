## Regeneration Notes

- **First Attempt Issue**: Only showed 4 boxes instead of 5 - Step 3 ("Check Issues") was completely missing from the horizontal flow
- **Fix Applied**: Clicked "Redo" button in Gemini, second generation included all 5 steps correctly
- **Success Factors (v2)**: All 5 steps present with correct numbering, titles, and subtitles, horizontal flow clear
- **If Regenerating**: If any step is missing, use Redo button immediately to regenerate with same prompt

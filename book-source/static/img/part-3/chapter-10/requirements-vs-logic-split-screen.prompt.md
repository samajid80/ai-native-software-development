  - Each step in 18pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
  - 16px line spacing between steps
  - Steps:
    "1. Validate email format"
    "2. Check database for duplicates"
    "3. Hash password with bcrypt"
    "4. Create user record"
    "5. Return user object"
  - Clean, minimal bullets (number + period)

Center Divider Enhancement:
- Arrow graphic overlaying divider line pointing from left → right
- Arrow color: Deep Navy (#001f3f), bold 4px stroke
- Arrow positioned at vertical center
- Small label below arrow: "Transform" in 16pt Roboto Medium, Deep Navy (#001f3f)

Typography:
- Headers: 28pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subheaders: 20pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Left content: 24pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Right content (steps): 18pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Arrow label: 16pt Roboto Medium, Deep Navy (#001f3f)

Color Palette (Polar Night Theme):
- Background right: White (#FFFFFF)
- Background left: Light Gray (#F8F9FA)
- Primary accent: Deep Navy (#001f3f) - headers, divider, arrow
- Secondary accent: Medium Gray (#aaaaaa) - subheaders, borders

Visual Elements:
- Divider: Clean vertical line, 4px solid Deep Navy (#001f3f)

- Shadows: Subtle 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) on left content box only
- Right side: No box around list (clean text layout)

Content:
- Left shows vague requirement (single statement)
- Right shows specific implementation steps (numbered logic)
- Arrow emphasizes transformation from vague → specific
- Visual contrast: single box vs structured list

IMPORTANT Spelling (letter-by-letter):
- "R-E-G-I-S-T-R-A-T-I-O-N" (registration)
- "V-A-L-I-D-A-T-E" (Validate)

Negative Instructions:
- NO extra examples beyond the one shown
- NO decorative icons or graphics beyond arrow
- NO additional text beyond specified headers and content
- NO borders or boxes on right side (keep list clean)
- Arrow should be SIMPLE directional indicator, NO complex shapes

## Regeneration Notes

- **First Attempt Issue**: Spelling safeguards were misinterpreted - showed "R-EGISTRATION" and "V-ALIDATE" with actual hyphens in the words instead of "registration" and "Validate"
- **Fix Applied**: Clicked "Redo" button in Gemini, second generation rendered correctly without hyphenation
- **Success Factors (v2)**: Split-screen layout clear, transformation arrow effective, spelling correct on second try
- **If Regenerating**: If spelling safeguards cause hyphenation again, immediately use Redo button rather than regenerating entire prompt

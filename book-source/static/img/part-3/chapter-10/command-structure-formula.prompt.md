Professional educational diagram showing the 3-part command structure formula for AI prompts.

Layout: Horizontal formula with example (1792x1024px canvas, 16:9 aspect ratio)
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Center alignment, generous white space

Top Section - Formula (upper 40% of canvas):
- Three boxes in horizontal row, connected by plus signs
- Box 1: "VERB" label in 24pt Roboto Medium, Deep Navy (#001f3f)

- Box 3: "DESIRED OUTCOME" label in 24pt Roboto Medium, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Each box: Rounded rectangle, 3px border Medium Gray (#aaaaaa), 240px width x 120px height
- Label centered in each box
- 80px horizontal spacing between boxes

Middle Section - Arrow (20% of canvas):
- Single downward arrow, 3px stroke, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Arrow points from formula to example
- Clean, simple arrow design

Bottom Section - Example (lower 40% of canvas):
- Three boxes showing concrete example, same layout as formula
- Box 1: "Create" in 28pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Plus sign: "+" in 48pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Box 2: "Python function" in 28pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Plus sign: "+" in 48pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Box 3: "validates email with regex" in 22pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Each box: Same rounded rectangle style (3px border Medium Gray), consistent sizing
- Content centered in boxes

Typography:
- Formula labels: 24pt Roboto Medium, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Example content: 28pt Roboto Regular (verbs), 22pt for outcomes, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Plus signs: 48pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)

Color Palette (Polar Night Theme):
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Primary accent: Deep Navy (#001f3f) - formula labels
- Secondary accent: Medium Gray (#aaaaaa) - borders, plus signs, arrow
- Text primary: Dark Charcoal (#111111) - example content
- Box borders: Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)

Visual Elements:
- Boxes: Rounded rectangles (8px border-radius), 3px border Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Arrow: Simple downward pointing arrow, 3px stroke, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Plus signs: Bold and prominent to show addition/combination
- Shadows: Subtle 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) on boxes only

Content:
- Top row teaches abstract formula structure
- Arrow indicates "instantiation" or "application"
- Bottom row shows concrete example applying formula
- Clean, symmetrical layout emphasizing 3-part pattern

IMPORTANT Spelling (letter-by-letter):
- "V-A-L-I-D-A-T-E-S" (validates)

Negative Instructions:
- NO extra text beyond specified labels and example
- NO decorative backgrounds or patterns
- NO additional examples (one example only keeps it clean)
- NO borders around entire canvas (only around boxes)
- Arrow should be SIMPLE, NO text label on arrow itself

Style Reference: Modern tech publication aesthetic (Stripe, a16z, minimalist formula diagrams)

Quality: professional, high-quality, publication-ready, clean, modern, editorial

Dimensions: 16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px)

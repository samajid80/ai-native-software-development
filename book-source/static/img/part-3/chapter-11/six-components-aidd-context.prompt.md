## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Professional educational component diagram showing the six strategic components of AIDD context engineering.

Layout: 3x2 grid of component cards (1792x1024px canvas, 16:9 aspect ratio)
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Center alignment with generous spacing
- Grid: 3 columns, 2 rows

Card Structure - Six Equal Cards:
- Each card: 480px width x 380px height
- Rounded rectangle, 3px border Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Background: Light Gray (#F8F9FA)
- 80px horizontal spacing, 60px vertical spacing between cards
- Each card contains: number, title, subtitle

Card 1 (Top Left) - Model Selection:
- Number circle at top: "1" in 28pt Roboto Bold, White on Deep Navy (#001f3f) circle (48px diameter)
- Title: "Model Selection" in 24pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle: "Which AI tool?" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Center-aligned content
- 24px padding

Card 2 (Top Center) - Development Tools:
- Number: "2" (same style)
- Title: "Development Tools" in 24pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle: "Code access" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)

Card 3 (Top Right) - Knowledge & Memory:
- Number: "3" (same style)
- Title: "Knowledge & Memory" in 24pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle: "What AI remembers" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)

Card 4 (Bottom Left) - Audio/Speech:
- Number: "4" (same style)
- Title: "Audio / Speech" in 24pt Roboto Bold, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Subtitle: "Not for coding" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Light Gray (#dddddd)
- NOTE: This card visually de-emphasized (grayed out) as it's not relevant for coding

Card 5 (Bottom Center) - Guardrails:
- Number: "5" (same style)
- Title: "Guardrails" in 24pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle: "Quality standards" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)

Card 6 (Bottom Right) - Orchestration:
- Number: "6" (same style)
- Title: "Orchestration" in 24pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle: "Workflow coordination" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)

Typography:
- Card numbers: 28pt Roboto Bold, White on Deep Navy circle
- Card titles: 24pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f) or Medium Gray (#aaaaaa for card 4)
- Card subtitles: 16pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa) or Light Gray (#dddddd for card 4)

Color Palette (Polar Night Theme):
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Card backgrounds: Light Gray (#F8F9FA)
- Primary accent: Deep Navy (#001f3f) - borders, number circles, active titles
- Secondary accent: Medium Gray (#aaaaaa) - subtitles, card 4 title
- Text tertiary: Light Gray (#dddddd) - card 4 subtitle (de-emphasized)
- Number circles: Deep Navy (#001f3f) fill, White (#FFFFFF) text

Visual Elements:
- Cards: Rounded rectangles (8px border-radius), 3px border Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Number circles: Solid Deep Navy fill, 48px diameter, centered at top of each card
- Shadows: Subtle 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) on all cards
- Card 4 (Audio/Speech): Slightly faded appearance to show "not applicable"

Content:
- 6 component cards organized in clean grid
- Each card shows component name and purpose
- Visual hierarchy emphasizes practical components (1-3, 5-6)
- Card 4 visually de-emphasized (audio not relevant for coding tasks)
- Scannable grid layout for quick reference

IMPORTANT Spelling (letter-by-letter):
- "O-R-C-H-E-S-T-R-A-T-I-O-N" (Orchestration)
- "C-O-O-R-D-I-N-A-T-I-O-N" (coordination)

Negative Instructions:
- NO detailed descriptions inside cards (title and subtitle only)
- NO icons or decorative graphics
- NO connecting lines between cards
- NO central hub or integration graphic (keep as independent component grid)
- NO additional text beyond number, title, subtitle
- Card 4 should be VISIBLY de-emphasized (lighter colors) but still readable

Style Reference: Modern tech publication aesthetic (component grids like design system documentation)

Quality: professional, high-quality, publication-ready, clean, modern, editorial

Dimensions: 16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px)

## Regeneration Notes

- **Success Factors**: Clean 3x2 grid layout, Card 4 appropriately de-emphasized, spelling safeguards worked
- **No Issues Detected**: First attempt met all quality criteria
- **If Regenerating**: Keep the same prompt - it worked perfectly on first try
- **Most Complex Visual**: This was the most complex visual (6 cards with individual formatting), but still succeeded on first try

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Professional educational diagram showing complementary relationship between context engineering and prompt engineering.

Layout: Layered foundation model (1792x1024px canvas, 16:9 aspect ratio)
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Center alignment with generous spacing

Visual Structure - Three Layers:

Layer 1 (Bottom/Foundation - 35% of canvas height):
- Wide rectangle: 1200px width x 200px height
- Background: Light Gray (#F8F9FA)
- Border: 4px Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Title centered: "CONTEXT ENGINEERING" in 28pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle below: "The Foundation" in 18pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Below subtitle: "What AI Knows" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Positioned at bottom third of canvas

Arrow 1 (Upward from Layer 1 to Layer 2):
- Clean upward pointing arrow, 4px stroke, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Arrow positioned at vertical center of Layer 1 top edge
- 120px height
- NO text on arrow itself

Layer 2 (Middle - 35% of canvas height):
- Wide rectangle: 1200px width x 200px height
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Border: 4px Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Title centered: "PROMPT ENGINEERING" in 28pt Roboto Bold, Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Subtitle below: "The Instructions" in 18pt Roboto Regular, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Below subtitle: "What You Ask" in 16pt Roboto Regular, Dark Charcoal (#111111)
- Positioned in middle of canvas

Arrow 2 (Upward from Layer 2 to Layer 3):
- Clean upward pointing arrow, 4px stroke, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- 120px height
- NO text on arrow itself

Layer 3 (Top/Output - 20% of canvas height):
- Rounded rectangle: 800px width x 160px height
- Background: Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Title centered: "Quality AI Output" in 28pt Roboto Bold, White (#FFFFFF)
- Subtitle below: "Project-Perfect Code" in 18pt Roboto Regular, Light Gray (#dddddd)
- Positioned at top third of canvas

Side Labels:
- Left side of Layer 1: "Strategic" in 16pt Roboto Medium, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa), vertical text or angled
- Left side of Layer 2: "Tactical" in 16pt Roboto Medium, Medium Gray (#aaaaaa), vertical text or angled

Typography:
- Layer titles: 28pt Roboto Bold
- Layer subtitles: 18pt Roboto Regular
- Descriptions: 16pt Roboto Regular
- Side labels: 16pt Roboto Medium

Color Palette (Polar Night Theme):
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Layer 1 background: Light Gray (#F8F9FA)
- Layer 2 background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Layer 3 background: Deep Navy (#001f3f)
- Primary accent: Deep Navy (#001f3f) - borders, titles
- Secondary accent: Medium Gray (#aaaaaa) - subtitles, arrows, side labels
- Text on dark: White (#FFFFFF) and Light Gray (#dddddd)
- Text on light: Dark Charcoal (#111111)

Visual Elements:
- Rectangles: Layer 1 and 2 have 4px borders Deep Navy, Layer 3 solid fill Deep Navy
- Arrows: Simple upward pointing arrows, 4px stroke Medium Gray (#aaaaaa)
- Shadows: Subtle 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) on all three layers
- Spacing: 120px vertical between layers (via arrows)

Content:
- Bottom-up flow showing foundation → instructions → output
- Visual hierarchy emphasizes context as base layer
- Arrows show dependency relationship
- Clean, layered architecture metaphor

IMPORTANT Spelling (letter-by-letter):
- "E-N-G-I-N-E-E-R-I-N-G" (Engineering - appears twice)
- "I-N-S-T-R-U-C-T-I-O-N-S" (Instructions)

Negative Instructions:
- NO detailed text inside layers beyond specified titles/subtitles
- NO decorative icons or graphics
- NO text labels ON arrows (arrows are directional only)
- NO comparison table or side-by-side layout (use layered foundation model)
- NO percentage indicators or metrics

Style Reference: Modern tech publication aesthetic (architecture diagrams like system design docs)

Quality: professional, high-quality, publication-ready, clean, modern, editorial

Dimensions: 16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px)

## Alt Text

Layered foundation diagram showing relationship between context engineering (bottom layer: The Foundation, What AI Knows), prompt engineering (middle layer: The Instructions, What You Ask), with arrows pointing upward to quality AI output (top layer: Project-Perfect Code). Emphasizes context as strategic foundation and prompts as tactical instructions.

## Regeneration Notes

- **Success Factors**: Clear layered foundation metaphor, upward flow shows dependency, spelling safeguards worked
- **No Issues Detected**: First attempt met all quality criteria
- **If Regenerating**: Keep the same prompt - it worked perfectly on first try

Lesson 4 implements Stage 2 (AI Collaboration) with mandatory Three Roles
framework. Students connect local Git repositories to GitHub for cloud backup
and portfolio building while experiencing bidirectional AI learning.

STAGE 2 (AI COLLABORATION) — THREE ROLES FRAMEWORK VERIFICATION
================================================================================

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All three roles MUST be demonstrated

Role 1: AI as Teacher                        ✓ PRESENT
  Location: "Role 1: AI as Teacher — Learning Dual Backup+Portfolio Value"
  What happens: AI suggests backup+portfolio dual value (student didn't ask)
  Callout: "AI taught you that backup and portfolio are dual values"
  Status: VALIDATED

Role 2: AI as Student (Student as Teacher)   ✓ PRESENT
  Location: "Role 2: AI as Student — You Teach AI Your Constraints"
  What happens: Student corrects AI ("Don't push secrets"), AI adapts
  Callout: "AI adapted its approach from naive 'push everything'"
  Status: VALIDATED

Role 3: AI as Co-Worker (Convergence)        ✓ PRESENT
  Location: "Role 3: AI as Co-Worker — Convergence Through Recovery Testing"
  What happens: Iteration 1→2→3, converge on safe isolation testing
  Callout: "Together you've designed safe recovery verification"
  Implementation: Activity 3.5 (clone in isolated directory)
  Status: VALIDATED

Bidirectional Learning Confirmed
  - Explicit "What You Learned" callouts after each role ✓
  - Explicit "What AI Learned" callouts after Role 2 ✓

================================================================================
ANTI-CONVERGENCE VALIDATION
================================================================================

Did NOT create generic GitHub tutorial pattern:
  ✅ NOT lecture-style ("Here's how to push...")
  ✅ NOT one-way instruction ("Tell AI to connect...")
  ✅ NOT perfect-first-try ("AI sets everything up perfectly")
  ✅ NOT all-concepts-in-one ("5+ concepts overwhelm")

DID create reasoning-activated implementation:
  ✅ Three Roles explicitly demonstrated (framework applied)
  ✅ Cognitive load counted and bounded (4 within A1: 5-7)
  ✅ Anti-convergence verified (differs from L1-3 and Ch7)
  ✅ Hands-on discovery activated (Execute → Observe → Understand)
  ✅ Security teaching integrated (.gitignore, secrets)
  ✅ Convergence iteration modeled (recovery testing approach)
  ✅ Student as teacher emphasized (corrects AI, teaches constraints)
  ✅ All commands tested (not hallucinated)

Status: SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATES FROM GENERIC PATTERNS

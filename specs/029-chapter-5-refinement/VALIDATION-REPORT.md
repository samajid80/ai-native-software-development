---

## T069: Stage Progression Mapping Verification ✅ COMPLETE

**README Stage Progression** (from book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/README.md):

```
Stage 1 (L1): Lessons 1-2
Stage 2 (L2): Lessons 3-7
Stage 3 (L3): Lesson 8
Stage 4 (L4): Lesson 9
```

**Lesson Metadata Stages**:

| Lesson | Declared Stage | Expected Stage | Match |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| L1 | L1 | L1 | ✅ |
| L2 | L1 | L1 | ✅ |
| L3 | L2 | L2 | ✅ |
| L4 | L2 | L2 | ✅ |
| L5 | L2 | L2 | ✅ |
| L6 | L2 | L2 | ✅ |
| L7 | L2 | L2 | ✅ |
| L8 | L3 | L3 | ✅ |
| L9 | L4 | L4 | ✅ |

**Assessment**: ✅ PERFECT ALIGNMENT (9/9 lessons match README progression)

---

## T070: Prerequisite Chain Verification ✅ COMPLETE

**Non-Circular Dependency Check**:

```
L1 (Origin Story): No prerequisites
L2 (Installation): L1 (origin story, paradigm shift)
L3 (CLAUDE.md): L2 (Claude Code installed)
L4 (MCP): L2-3 (Claude Code, CLAUDE.md)
L5 (Subagents): L2-4 (Claude Code, CLAUDE.md, MCP)
L6 (Skills): L2-5 (Claude Code, CLAUDE.md, MCP, Subagents)
L7 (Hooks): L2-6 (All prior features)
L8 (Settings): L2-7 (All prior features)
L9 (Plugins): L1-8 (Complete understanding of all features)
```

**Circularity Test**: No lesson depends on a later lesson ✅
**Forward References**: All prerequisites reference earlier lessons only ✅

**Assessment**: ✅ PREREQUISITE CHAINS VALID AND NON-CIRCULAR

---

## T071: Concept Count Accuracy ✅ COMPLETE

**Tier Limits** (from constitution):
- A2 tier: ≤7 concepts
- B1 tier: ≤10 concepts

**Declared Concept Counts vs Tier Limits**:

| Lesson | Stage | Tier | Concept Count | Limit | Status |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|-------|--------|
| L1 | L1 | A2 | 5 | ≤7 | ✅ |
| L2 | L1 | A2 | 8 | ≤7 | ⚠️ EXCEEDS |
| L3 | L2 | B1 | 6 | ≤10 | ✅ |
| L4 | L2 | B1 | 6 | ≤10 | ✅ |
| L5 | L2 | B1 | 6 | ≤10 | ✅ |
| L6 | L2 | B1 | 7 | ≤10 | ✅ |
| L7 | L2 | B1 | 5 | ≤10 | ✅ |
| L8 | L3 | B1 | 5 | ≤10 | ✅ |
| L9 | L4 | B1 | 8 | ≤10 | ✅ |

**Issue Identified**: Lesson 2 (L1/A2) declares 8 concepts but A2 tier limit is ≤7

**Manual Concept Recount for L2**:
1. Terminal-based AI (vs web-based)
2. Installation methods (4 options: Homebrew, npm, pipx, direct)
3. Authentication workflow
4. `claude --version` verification
5. Basic command execution
6. API key management
7. Configuration file basics
8. Troubleshooting common issues

**Actual Count**: 8 concepts
**Recommendation**: Lesson 2 could be re-staged as **B1** (installation is intermediate complexity) OR reduce to 7 concepts by combining related items

**Assessment**: ⚠️ 8/9 LESSONS COMPLIANT - L2 requires tier adjustment or concept reduction

---

## T074: "Why This Matters" Section Verification ✅ COMPLETE

**Required Lessons** (per spec.md FR4): 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

**Section Format Requirements**:
- 80-150 words
- Methodology-focused (not feature sales)
- Includes: Workflow Impact, Paradigm Connection, Real-World Context

**Results**:

| Lesson | Section Present | Methodology-Focused | Word Count | Format |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|------------|--------|
| L2 | ✅ | ✅ "Why This Matters: Terminal Integration for AI Workflows" | ~120 | ✅ |
| L4 | ✅ | ✅ "Why This Matters: Safe External Integration" | ~100 | ✅ |
| L5 | ✅ | ✅ "Why This Matters: Specialized Expertise" | ~90 | ✅ |
| L6 | ✅ | ✅ "Why This Matters: Reusable Organizational Capability" | ~110 | ✅ |
| L8 | ✅ | ✅ "Why Settings Hierarchy Matters for Team Intelligence" | ~130 | ✅ |
| L9 | ✅ | ✅ "Why This Matters: Composition as Organizational Practice" | ~140 | ✅ |

**Sample Quality Check (L9)**:
> "Plugins bundle everything you've learned (CLAUDE.md, MCP, Subagents, Skills, Hooks) into shareable, reusable packages... This is L4—spec-driven composition. You define WHAT you need... Teams can distribute organizational intelligence as plugins."

**Assessment**: ✅ ALL 6 REQUIRED SECTIONS PRESENT AND METHODOLOGY-FOCUSED

---

## T075: Three Roles Framework Verification ✅ COMPLETE

**Required Lessons** (per spec.md FR7): 3 (preserved), 4, 5, 6, 7 (enhanced)

**Three Roles Pattern**:
1. AI as Teacher (suggests pattern/knowledge student doesn't have)
2. AI as Student (receives context from user, user teaches AI)
3. AI as Co-Worker (convergence loop, iterative refinement)

**Results**:

| Lesson | Three Roles Present | Authentic Demonstration | Quality |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| L3 | ✅ (preserved) | ✅ CLAUDE.md generation workflow demonstrates all 3 roles | EXEMPLARY |
| L4 | ✅ (enhanced) | ✅ MCP exploration exercise: AI suggests→Student provides app context→Convergence | STRONG |
| L5 | ✅ (enhanced) | ✅ "Co-learn Subagent Design" Step 2.5: explicit co-design pattern | STRONG |
| L6 | ✅ (enhanced) | ✅ Step 4 skill design: AI teaches patterns→Student provides use case→Together refine | STRONG |
| L7 | ✅ (enhanced) | ✅ Step 5 "Co-Design a Hook": explicit Three Roles workflow | STRONG |

**Sample Quality Check (L5, Step 2.5)**:
> "🤝 Co-learn Subagent Design... AI as Teacher: Claude suggests appropriate subagent design patterns for research tasks. AI as Student: You provide context... AI as Co-Worker: Together you refine the design..."

**Assessment**: ✅ ALL 5 LESSONS DEMONSTRATE AUTHENTIC THREE ROLES COLLABORATION

## T065: SANDBOX-AUDIT-REPORT.md 🔲 PENDING

**Status**: Cannot create until T057-T064 sandbox tests are executed
**Location**: Will be created at `specs/029-chapter-5-refinement/SANDBOX-AUDIT-REPORT.md`
**Content**: Execution logs, pass/fail status, any fixes required

---

## T073: Theory-to-Practice Ratio Verification 🔲 MANUAL REQUIRED

**Target**: ≥60% hands-on practice

**Practice Indicators**:
- 🤝 Practice Exercise sections
- 💬 "Try With AI" / "Ask Claude" prompts
- "Try this" code blocks
- Hands-On workflows
- Step-by-step exercises

**Theory Indicators**:
- Explanatory paragraphs
- Definition sections
- Conceptual diagrams
- Background/context sections

**Status**: Requires manual paragraph counting across all 9 lessons

**Spot Check (L6 - Agent Skills)**:
- Practice blocks: "Hands-On: Create Your First Skill" (87 lines), "Try With AI" (27 lines) = ~114 lines
- Theory blocks: Definitions, explanations = ~222 lines
- **Ratio**: 114/(114+222) = 34% practice ⚠️ BELOW TARGET
- **Note**: This is post-reduction. Original L6 had more practice examples that were trimmed.

**Recommendation**: Full manual count required for all 9 lessons to verify 60% target

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Lesson 2 Concept Count Exceeds A2 Tier Limit
**Severity**: LOW
**Impact**: Constitutional compliance (Progressive Complexity principle)
**Current**: 8 concepts (A2 tier limit is ≤7)
**Options**:
1. Re-stage Lesson 2 as B1 (installation is intermediate complexity)
2. Reduce concept count to 7 (combine related concepts)
3. Accept as-is with justification (installation inherently has multiple concepts)

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Re-stage as B1 (installation involves multiple tools/methods, appropriate for intermediate)

### Issue 2: L6 Theory-to-Practice Ratio Concern
**Severity**: LOW
**Impact**: Show-Through-Doing principle compliance
**Current**: Spot check shows 34% practice (target ≥60%)
**Context**: Post-reduction from 552→336 lines, removed some redundant examples
**Recommendation**: Full manual count across all lessons required to confirm if this is isolated or chapter-wide issue

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Address Issue 1 (L2 tier adjustment) if required
2. **User/QA**: Execute sandbox tests T057-T064 in clean environment
3. **User/QA**: Verify CLI commands and feature claims (T066-T067)
4. **User/QA**: Complete theory-to-practice ratio count (T073)
5. **After Sandbox Tests**: Create SANDBOX-AUDIT-REPORT.md (T065)
6. **Final**: Review all validation results, create implementation PHR

---

## Constitutional Compliance Assessment

**7 Core Principles**:

1. ✅ **Specification Primacy**: Methodology before features (all "Why This Matters" sections)
2. ⚠️ **Progressive Complexity**: 8/9 lessons compliant (L2 tier adjustment needed)
3. 🔲 **Factual Accuracy**: Pending sandbox testing (T057-T064)
4. ✅ **Coherent Structure**: L1→L2→L3→L4 progression explicit and traceable
5. ✅ **Intelligence Accumulation**: Capstone (L9) integrates all prior concepts
6. ✅ **Anti-Convergence**: Surgical targeting (varied reduction strategies per lesson)
7. 🔲 **Minimal Content**: Pending theory-to-practice ratio verification (T073)

**Overall**: 4/7 verified ✅, 1/7 minor issue ⚠️, 2/7 pending manual testing 🔲

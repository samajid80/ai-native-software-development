# Requirements Validation Checklist

**Feature**: Chapter 8 Redesign - Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development
**Validated**: 2025-01-17
**Agent**: spec-architect v2.0
**Status**: READY

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification maintains technology-agnostic approach while teaching Git as safety system. Constitutional intelligence object provides clear pedagogical framing.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3 prioritized)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (constraints + non-goals)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: 1 clarification marker exists (FR-030 skill format) with well-structured options. Edge cases comprehensive (7 scenarios). Non-goals section explicit about exclusions.

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Evals-first pattern followed (evals before spec)

**Notes**: 37 functional requirements map to 4-stage progression. User scenarios include independent testing criteria. Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-019) are measurable and defined before functional requirements.

## Overall Assessment

**Readiness Score**: 9/10

**Verdict**: READY FOR PLANNING

**Reasoning**: Specification demonstrates exceptional completeness with constitutional grounding, measurable success criteria, explicit constraints/non-goals, and comprehensive edge case coverage. Single clarification marker (skill format) has informed recommendation and does not block planning. All acceptance scenarios testable and technology-agnostic.

**Next Steps**:
1. Human reviewer approval recommended
2. Resolve skill format clarification (Option A recommended in spec)
3. Proceed to chapter-planner for lesson breakdown

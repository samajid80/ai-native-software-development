# Feature Specification: Chapter 8 Redesign - Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

**Feature Branch**: `028-chapter-8-git-redesign`
**Created**: 2025-01-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Redesign Chapter 8 (Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development) with Agent HQ introduction and constitutional pedagogical improvements

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the redesign of Chapter 8 to teach Git as a **safety system for AI-driven development** rather than command memorization. The chapter serves A1/A2 aspiring beginners (Part 2) who completed Chapter 7 (Bash) and need Git confidence to experiment fearlessly with AI-generated code.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Safety-first mental model**: Every Git concept frames as "this enables safe AI experimentation"
- **Hands-on discovery pedagogy**: Students execute Git commands and observe outcomes (varying from Chapter 7's direct teaching)
- **GitHub Agent HQ awareness**: Introduce 2025's multi-agent orchestration platform at awareness-level (not implementation)
- **4-Stage progression**: Manual foundation → AI collaboration → Reusable intelligence → Capstone integration
- **Cognitive load calibration**: A1/A2 tier (5-7 concepts/section max, 2 workflow options max)

**Constitutional Grounding**: Principles 1-7 applied (see Intelligence Object below).

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Safe AI Code Experimentation (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A beginner asks Claude Code to generate a Python calculator. They're unsure if the code is good. They need to test it safely, knowing they can undo if it breaks.

**Journey**:
1. Student has project folder with existing code
2. Asks AI: "Create a Git commit before AI makes changes"
3. AI executes `git add .` and `git commit -m "Before calculator"`
4. Student asks AI to generate calculator code
5. Tests calculator—realizes it's buggy
6. Asks AI: "Undo Git changes to go back"
7. AI executes `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
8. Student is back to working state, experiments again fearlessly

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition of Git for AI development—safety enables experimentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a test project, committing, making changes, and reverting. Delivers immediate safety value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has uncommitted code, **When** student asks AI "commit my changes", **Then** AI executes `git add . && git commit` and student has restore point
2. **Given** student committed before AI changes, **When** AI generates buggy code, **Then** student asks "undo last commit" and returns to working state
3. **Given** student experiments with 3 different AI suggestions, **When** each has commit, **Then** student can jump to any previous version using Git

---

### User Story 2 - GitHub Backup & Portfolio (Priority: P2)

**Scenario**: Student builds multiple AI-assisted projects locally. Computer crashes—all work lost. Student needs cloud backup and wants to show projects to employers.

**Journey**:
1. Student creates GitHub account (free)
2. Creates repository on GitHub for project
3. Asks AI: "Connect my local project to GitHub"
4. AI configures remote and pushes code
5. Student accesses project from any computer
6. Shares GitHub profile link on resume/LinkedIn

**Why this priority**: Backup prevents catastrophic loss; portfolio demonstrates skills to employers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating local project, pushing to GitHub, cloning from different machine. Delivers backup + sharing value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has local Git repository, **When** student creates GitHub repo and asks AI "push to GitHub", **Then** code appears on GitHub (cloud backup achieved)
2. **Given** student's computer fails, **When** student accesses GitHub from new machine, **Then** all projects are recoverable via `git clone`
3. **Given** student wants to share project, **When** student sends GitHub URL, **Then** recipient sees code, commits, and project history (portfolio demonstrated)

---

### User Story 3 - Branch Testing for AI Suggestions (Priority: P3)

**Scenario**: AI suggests two different implementations for a feature (Option A: simple, Option B: advanced). Student wants to test both without losing either.

**Journey**:
1. Student on `main` branch with working code
2. Asks AI: "Create branch to test Option A"
3. AI executes `git checkout -b option-a`
4. Student tests Option A—works but slow
5. Asks AI: "Switch to main, create branch for Option B"
6. AI executes `git checkout main && git checkout -b option-b`
7. Tests Option B—faster but complex
8. Compares both, chooses Option B, merges to main

**Why this priority**: Enables parallel experimentation—key AI-era skill. Less critical than P1/P2 but valuable for workflow optimization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating test project, branching, implementing alternatives, comparing results. Delivers advanced workflow capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student on `main` branch, **When** student asks AI "create feature branch", **Then** AI creates branch and student experiments without affecting main code
2. **Given** student has 2 experimental branches, **When** student tests both implementations, **Then** student compares outcomes and chooses best approach
3. **Given** student chooses winning branch, **When** student asks AI "merge to main", **Then** chosen implementation becomes main codebase (other branch preserved for reference)

---

### User Story 4 - GitHub Agent HQ Awareness (Priority: P4)

**Scenario**: Student reads tech news about "GitHub Agent HQ" and wonders how it relates to their learning. They need awareness of where the platform is heading without implementation complexity.

**Journey**:
1. Student completes core Git workflows (P1-P3)
2. Encounters "Agent HQ" mention in lesson
3. Learns: "GitHub now orchestrates multiple AI agents (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) from one platform"
4. Understands: Mission control interface, multi-agent coordination, branch controls for agent-generated code
5. Recognizes: This is the future they're preparing for, but not today's focus
6. Continues with core Git mastery, aware of emerging platform evolution

**Why this priority**: Future-awareness motivates learning; avoids skill obsolescence anxiety. Lower priority because it's aspirational, not immediately actionable for beginners.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by presenting Agent HQ content and assessing student understanding of: (1) what Agent HQ is, (2) how it differs from current GitHub, (3) why it matters for their future. Delivers platform evolution awareness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student completes core Git workflows, **When** student encounters Agent HQ section, **Then** student understands "GitHub is becoming multi-agent orchestration platform"
2. **Given** student learns about Agent HQ features, **When** asked "How does this relate to your workflow?", **Then** student explains "I'm learning Git fundamentals that will work with Agent HQ's advanced coordination"
3. **Given** student aware of Agent HQ, **When** they read future tech announcements, **Then** student recognizes Git skills are foundation for agentic development era (reduces learning anxiety)

### Edge Cases

- **No Git installed**: Student attempts Git commands without installation → AI detects missing Git, guides through installation (OS-specific)
- **Existing Git repository**: Student runs `git init` in folder already tracked by Git → AI detects `.git` directory, explains "Already a repository"
- **Merge conflicts**: Student's manual edits conflict with Git operations → AI explains conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), demonstrates "keep both" vs "keep one" resolution, NO advanced merge strategies (awareness-level: show conflict syntax, explain basic resolution, avoid 3-way merge algorithms or rebase workflows)
- **Authentication failures**: Student attempts GitHub push without credentials → AI guides through PAT (Personal Access Token) setup or SSH key configuration
- **Detached HEAD state**: Student checks out specific commit → AI detects detached HEAD, explains implications, guides back to branch
- **Large files**: Student tries committing video/dataset (>100MB) → AI warns about GitHub limits, suggests `.gitignore` or Git LFS (mention only)
- **Force push dangers**: Student wants to overwrite remote history → AI warns about destructive operations, suggests safer alternatives (reset vs revert)

## Open Questions & Clarifications

### [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Skill Format for Stage 3]

**Context**: FR-030 requires students create `git-workflow` skill as reusable intelligence. Unclear format expectations.

**Question**: What format should the `git-workflow` skill use?

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A. Simple Markdown Guide** | Students create `git-workflow.md` with workflow checklist | Easy for beginners; portable; no tool dependency | Not integrated with Claude Code; manual reference |
| **B. Claude Code Skill Syntax** | Students create `.claude/skills/git-workflow/` following skill format | Integrated with AI assistant; reusable across projects | Requires teaching skill syntax (meta-complexity) |
| **C. Hybrid Approach** | Markdown guide + optional Claude Code skill for advanced students | Flexibility; accommodates different learner levels | More content to create; potential confusion |

**Recommendation**: Option A (Simple Markdown Guide) aligns with A1/A2 tier. Option B deferred to Part 5 (Spec-Driven Development) where skill creation is explicit topic.
